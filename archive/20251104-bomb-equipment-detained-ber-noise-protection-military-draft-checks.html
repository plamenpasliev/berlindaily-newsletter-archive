<h2 id="🇬🇧-berlin-police-arrest-man-for-planning-jihadi-attack">🇬🇧 Berlin police arrest man for planning &#39;jihadi&#39; attack</h2>
<p class="excerpt">Berlin prosecutors said a 22-year-old Syrian man was arrested on Saturday on suspicion of preparing a jihadi-motivated attack. Special Task Force officers detained him after searches at three addresses found equipment to build a bomb. Officials said he arrived in 2023 and shared Islamic State propaganda online. Ministers Alexander Dobrindt and Iris Spranger urged vigilance. (<a href="https://www.dw.com/en/berlin-police-arrest-syrian-man-for-planning-jihadi-attack/a-74591178">DW</a>)</p>
<p>The Spezialeinsatzkommando, or Special Operations Command, is Berlin’s elite state police unit for high‑risk situations. Founded in 1972 to counter terrorism, the SEK handles hostage crises, arrests of dangerous suspects, and operations where severe danger is expected. It supports criminal proceedings and resolves acute threats when regular policing is insufficient. (<a href="https://www.berlin.de/polizei/dienststellen/landeskriminalamt/lka-6/">Polizei Berlin</a>)</p>
<p>Berlin’s arrest points to a persistent, digitally driven threat that can emerge quickly and require rapid police action. Germany’s intelligence service recently assessed 28,280 Islamism‑linked individuals in 2024 and said the Islamic State’s jihadism remains the country’s foremost Islamist‑terrorist danger.

<h2 id="🇩🇪-ber-noise-protection-program-expires-on-tuesday">🇩🇪 BER noise protection program expires on Tuesday</h2>
<p class="excerpt">Berlin-Brandenburg Airport’s two-decade noise-protection program reaches its application deadline on Tuesday, November 4, 2025. Within a 155-square-kilometer zone, around 26,500 households are eligible; 86 percent had applied by September. The operator has paid about 466 million euros, with protections installed in over 5,000 homes and compensation promised to roughly 7,700; some 8,000 implementations remain open. (<a href="https://www.rbb24.de/panorama/beitrag/2025/10/flughafen-berlin-brandenburg-ber-schallschutz-frist-endet.html">rbb24</a>)</p>
<p>Germany’s passive aircraft-noise protection relies on the Federal Aircraft Noise Act. Authorities set day and night protection zones around airports, enabling cost coverage for measures such as sound-insulating windows and required ventilation; in certain cases, compensation is available for outdoor living areas. These tools complement “active” controls like operating restrictions and steeper climb procedures. (<a href="https://www.umweltbundesamt.de/themen/laerm/verkehrslaerm/fluglaerm">Umweltbundesamt</a>)</p>
<p>The expiring window and tight reimbursement cutoff raise the stakes for remaining households, while health risks from chronic noise exposure are well-documented. Europe-wide, just over 110 million people face harmful transport noise; the European Environment Agency links it to about 66,000 premature deaths annually and estimates yearly economic costs of at least 95.6 billion euros.

<h2 id="🇬🇧-germany-military-chief-wants-draft-checks-for-all-young-men">🇬🇧 Germany: Military chief wants draft checks for all young men</h2>
<p class="excerpt">Germany’s armed forces chief, General Inspector Carsten Breuer, rejected a draft lottery and said all young men should first be assessed for service. Screening entire age groups is vital to know who can serve, he argued. If volunteers fall short, he favors selecting especially qualified recruits, such as information technology specialists. The Bundestag debate continues. (<a href="https://www.dw.com/en/germany-news-military-chief-wants-draft-checks-for-all-young-men/live-74592710">DW</a>)</p>
<p>Several European neighbors are rebuilding conscription to raise readiness. Finland plans to lift the reservist age limit to 65, adding about 125,000 people and bringing its reserves to one million by 2031. Military service is mandatory for men, with women volunteering. The move followed its entry into the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. (<a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/finland-plans-raise-reservists-age-limit-add-125000-troops-wartime-army-2025-05-14/">Reuters</a>)</p>
<p>Breuer’s stance signals a shift toward broader mobilization readiness and skills-based selection, not a blind lottery. It reflects pressure to close personnel gaps fast. Indeed, Germany’s military commissioner warns of a 25% dropout among new recruits within six months, with just over 181,000 soldiers today, far from the 203,000 goal.

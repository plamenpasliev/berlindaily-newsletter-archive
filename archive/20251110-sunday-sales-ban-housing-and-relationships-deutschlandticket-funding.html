<h2 id="🇩🇪-sunday-sales-ban-only-the-swiss-are-as-crazy-as-us-germans">🇩🇪 Sunday sales ban: &quot;Only the Swiss are as crazy as us Germans&quot;</h2>
<p class="excerpt">Berlin’s retail association renewed calls to liberalize Sunday shopping. In an interview, Handelsverband Berlin-Brandenburg chief Nils Busch-Petersen argued that Germany’s general Sunday sales ban is no longer timely. He criticized Berlin’s administration for scheduling only four of eight permitted citywide open Sundays. He said such limits disadvantage physical retailers compared with other sales channels. Many employees volunteer for Sunday shifts because pay is higher and average receipts increase. (<a href="https://www.berliner-zeitung.de/panorama/verkaufsverbot-am-sonntag-so-verrueckt-wie-wir-deutschen-sind-nur-noch-die-schweizer-li.10004048">Berliner Zeitung</a>)</p>
<p>“Sunday rest” means Sundays and recognized holidays are protected as days of rest and spiritual elevation. German courts interpret this as a rule‑exception system that requires a weighty reason for openings and visible primacy of the non‑work character on those days. This principle anchors today’s limits on Sunday trading. (<a href="https://www.bverwg.de/de/pm/2020/36">Bundesverwaltungsgericht</a>)</p>
<p>This debate signals tension between constitutional protections, a global visitor economy, and digital shopping habits. German e‑commerce returned to growth in 2024, rising 1.1 percent to €80.6 billion, underscoring weekend online demand that competes with closed high streets. (<a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/retail-consumer/german-e-commerce-sales-rise-first-time-since-2021-says-lobby-group-2025-01-23/">Reuters</a>)</p>

<h2 id="🇩🇪-i-cheated---on-the-real-estate-market">🇩🇪 &quot;I cheated - on the real estate market&quot;</h2>
<p class="excerpt">Berlin&#39;s severe housing shortage actively pressures romantic relationships. High rents often force couples to move in together prematurely, driven by financial necessity rather than emotional readiness. This same lack of affordable space also deters many partners from expanding their families, as they simply cannot afford a larger home.</p>
<p>The housing crisis also dictates how relationships end. Many people remain trapped living with an ex-partner after a breakup because they cannot find a new, affordable apartment. This difficult search forces individuals, especially singles, to secure new housing before they can even initiate a separation. (<a href="https://www.rbb24.de/panorama/beitrag/2025/11/immobilienmarkt-berlin-beziehung-mietvertrag-miete-wohnungsnot.html">rbb24.de</a>)</p>
<p>This dynamic pushes personal decisions into economic calculations and nudges relocations within the region. Current market prices show the strain. In third quarter 2025, new-build asking rents in Berlin averaged 20.65 euros per square meter, or 1,446 euros for a 70 square meter flat.

<h2 id="🇩🇪-funding-for-the-deutschlandticket-secured-until-2030">🇩🇪 Funding for the Deutschlandticket secured until 2030</h2>
<p class="excerpt">The Bundestag has secured financing for the Deutschlandticket (Germany Ticket) until the end of 2030. The federal and state governments will each contribute 1.5 billion euros annually. The monthly price will rise from 58 to 63 euros on January 1st. Starting in 2027, a cost index will control future price developments. The Bundesrat must still give its approval.</p>
<p>Approximately 14 million people currently use the ticket. It launched in 2023 at 49 euros per month. Transport associations report revenue shortfalls, which the subsidies are intended to offset. Criticism arose over deviations from the coalition agreement, which had stipulated increases would only begin in 2029. Consumer advocacy groups called the decision a broken promise. (<a href="https://www.tagesschau.de/inland/gesellschaft/deutschlandticket-finanzierung-108.html">tagesschau.de</a>)</p>
<p>Since its introduction, the number of public transport subscriptions has risen by 62 percent. According to the association, its use has saved around 2.3 million metric tons of CO2. Approximately 23 million people have purchased the ticket at least once. (<a href="https://www.vdv.de/deutschlandticket.aspx">VDV</a>)</p>

<h2 id="🇬🇧-berlin-bürgeramt-box-means-residents-can-collect-documents-247">🇬🇧 Berlin Bürgeramt box means residents can collect documents 24/7</h2>
<p class="excerpt">Berlin has introduced its first 24/7 document collection box at the Eichborndamm Bürgeramt (citizens’ office) in Reinickendorf. Residents must still apply in person for passports, ID cards, and residence permits, but they now receive a PIN by mobile phone and can pick up finished documents from the box at any time without an appointment. (<a href="https://www.iamexpat.de/expat-info/germany-news/berlin-burgeramt-box-means-residents-can-collect-documents-247">IamExpat</a>)</p>
<p>Berlin’s Bürgerämter are under pressure from a growing and highly mobile population. At the end of 2024, the city had about 3.9 million registered residents, the highest level since 1991, after gaining roughly 19,000 people in a single year, largely through international migration. This growth increases demand for identity and residence documents. (<a href="https://themunicheye.com/Population-Growth-in-Berlin-Continues-12119">The Munich Eye</a>)</p>
<p>Digitalization is meant to relieve that pressure, but progress is mixed. An industry analysis found around 60 % of administrative services nationwide are now available online, yet only 37 % of users are satisfied with digital application processes. Many citizens still face long waits or confusing systems when dealing with public offices.

<h2 id="⚡-quick-hits">⚡ Quick Hits</h2>
<p>🇩🇪 <a href="https://www.rbb24.de/panorama/beitrag/2025/11/berlin-mitte-hauptbahnhof-fernwaermeausfall-wegen-reparaturarbei.html"><em>District heating failure around Berlin Central Station rectified</em></a> | District heating, which supplies central hot water and heating, was shut off for several hours around Berlin’s main station due to pipe repair work. Provider BEW restored service earlier than planned, and temperatures are now rising again. Fewer customers were affected than on Sunday, when a separate power plant fault cut heating for tens of thousands of households.</p>
<p>🇩🇪 <a href="https://www.tagesspiegel.de/berlin/wintereinbruch-in-berlin-und-brandenburg-zu-schnee-eis-und-frost-kommt-regen--glatteis-inklusive-14924843.html"><em>Onset of winter in Berlin and Brandenburg Snow, ice, frost and rain - warning of black ice</em></a> | Berlin and Brandenburg started the week with up to 3 centimeters of fresh snow, ice and temperatures as low as minus 5 degrees. Public transport in Berlin is disrupted, especially bus lines. Police report relatively few accidents, mostly minor damage. The German Weather Service warns of recurring black ice, fog and light snow or sleet through midweek.</p>
<p>🇩🇪 <a href="https://www.bz-berlin.de/berlin/weihnachtsmarkt-vergleich-preis-angebot"><em>Christmas market comparison! What&#39;s on offer and what it costs</em></a> | Visitors can expect mostly unchanged prices across Berlin’s major Christmas markets, with Glühwein typically around 5 euros and Bratwurst about 5 to 6 euros. Entry is largely free, except at Gendarmenmarkt, which charges 2 euros for most adults. All locations list visible security and barriers, reflecting a strong focus on safety alongside varied rides, shows, and crafts.</p>
<p>🇩🇪 <a href="https://www.morgenpost.de/berlin/article410532538/sanierung-des-u-bahnhofs-nollendorfplatz-das-kommt-auf-fahrgaeste-zu.html"><em>Renovation of Nollendorfplatz subway station: what passengers can expect</em></a> | From 12 January to mid‑May 2026, most lines at Berlin’s Nollendorfplatz hub will be shut, affecting U1, U3 and U4 and leaving only U2 in service. BVG plans denser U2 traffic, longer trains and bus replacements. The 4.3 million euro works repair century‑old, moisture‑damaged concrete, with debris removed by hand to reduce noise and dust.</p>
<p>🇩🇪 <a href="https://www.tagesspiegel.de/berlin/klare-mehrheit-gegen-olympia-zwei-drittel-der-berliner-lehnen-bewerbung-um-die-sommerspiele-ab-14922329.html"><em>Do Berliners want the Olympics in the city? New survey comes to a clear conclusion</em></a> | A new Civey poll for the Tagesspiegel finds 67 percent of Berliners reject a Summer Olympics bid for 2036, 2040 or 2044, while only 27 percent support it. The result boosts the “NOlympia” campaign, which plans a referendum from 2027. The timing could see Berliners overturn a potential DOSB selection after the fact.</p>
<p>🇬🇧 <a href="https://www.the-berliner.com/english-news-berlin/33-year-old-man-attacked-by-six-men-in-gorlitzer-park/"><em>Man attacked by six others in Görlitzer Park</em></a> | Police say six men attacked a 33-year-old man in Görlitzer Park after questioning his sexual orientation. The assailants allegedly beat him on the ground and hit him with beer bottles, causing minor head and torso injuries. The case is being investigated as grievous bodily harm. Authorities report queer hate crimes are up 18% in 2024.</p>
<p>🇩🇪 <a href="https://www.ingenieur.de/technik/fachbereiche/verkehr/autonomes-fahren-wie-deutschland-das-rennen-verliert/"><em>Autonomous driving: How Germany is losing the race</em></a> | Germany’s carmakers lead in highly regulated Level‑3 systems but risk falling behind in higher autonomy. A new study finds Chinese firms generate 70% of global driver-assistance innovation, versus 14% in Germany. China’s looser rules and data-rich robotaxi fleets let players like Baidu, XPeng and Huawei scale faster, while German brands scramble for software alliances.</p>

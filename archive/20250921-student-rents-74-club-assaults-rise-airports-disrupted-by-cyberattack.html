<h2 id="🇩🇪-how-much-rents-for-shared-flats-have-risen">🇩🇪 How much rents for shared flats have risen</h2>
<p> A study by the research institute Empirica finds that rents for rooms in student flat-shares in Germany have risen 74% since 2012, roughly twice the increase in consumer prices, with major city gaps (about €750 in Munich versus €350 in Siegen).</p>
<p>Housing shortages and rising student numbers have tightened the market, making rent a key factor in where students enroll. Limited building—especially around big-city suburbs—and more graduates staying in cities keep demand high and push shared-room prices up in line with broader rents.</p>
<p>Experts say only more construction and land development, largely in metropolitan outskirts, will ease pressures, but any relief will be gradual, so student housing affordability is likely to remain strained through upcoming semesters. <em>(<a href="https://www.tagesschau.de/wirtschaft/verbraucher/wg-zimmer-teurer-als-inflation-100.html">tagesschau.de</a>, 3 minute read)</em></p>

<h2 id="🇩🇪-assaults-at-sex-positive-parties-when-a-no-is-not-enough">🇩🇪 Assaults at sex-positive parties: when a no is not enough</h2>
<p> Multiple attendees reported sexual assaults at Berlin’s sex-positive clubs; police recorded 87 club-related cases last year, compared with 16 in 2016, after a 2023 peak of 98. The KitKat club said it will make its previously undercover awareness teams more visible.</p>
<p>Advocates say consent violations persist despite the scene’s reputation for strong boundaries, with substance use complicating memories and many incidents going unreported. Experts argue safer-party measures help but cannot fix wider social attitudes about entitlement and gender norms.</p>
<p>Officials and club groups may expand visible awareness staffing and tailored safety protocols; watch for updates to club policies, potential public funding for training, and whether reporting increases. <em>(<a href="https://www.rbb24.de/panorama/beitrag/2025/09/berlin-sexpositive-partys-clubs-uebergriffe-gewalt.html">rbb24</a>, 6 minute read)</em></p>

<h2 id="🇩🇪-ber-and-brussels-airport-experience-chaos-saturday-after-cyber-attack">🇩🇪 BER and Brussels Airport experience chaos Saturday after cyber attack</h2>
<p> A cyberattack on Collins Aerospace, a provider of airport passenger processing software, disrupted check-in and baggage systems at several European airports Saturday, causing long lines and delays at Berlin-Brandenburg and cancellations and delays in Brussels.</p>
<p>Berlin cut connections to the affected systems and switched to manual processing; the airport said it was not directly targeted. RTX, Collins’ parent, confirmed the software disruption. The incident highlights rising cyber risks to aviation suppliers, which can ripple across multiple hubs.</p>
<p>Manual operations may continue Sunday, and Eurocontrol asked airlines to halve Brussels flights until Monday morning; expect delays and some cancellations while RTX works to restore service. <em>(<a href="https://www.spiegel.de/netzwelt/ber-und-bruessel-airport-erleben-chaos-samstag-nach-cyberangriff-a-c3c1da38-2e13-49e5-b215-707ee64925ee">Spiegel</a>, 2 minute read)</em></p>

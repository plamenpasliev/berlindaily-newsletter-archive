<h2 id="🇩🇪-senate-adopts-heat-action-plan-for-berlin">🇩🇪 Senate adopts &quot;heat action plan&quot; for Berlin</h2>
<p class="excerpt">The Berlin Senate has adopted a new “heat action plan” to better protect residents from rising temperatures. The plan combines 72 measures, some already underway, including “Cooling Points” in public buildings for rest and hydration, more drinking fountains, additional street trees and green spaces, and heat helpers in large housing estates. (<a href="https://www.tagesspiegel.de/berlin/strassenbaume-warnsysteme-und-cooling-points-senat-beschliesst-hitzeaktionsplan-fur-berlin-14940680.html">Tagesspiegel</a>)</p>
<p>Germany is experiencing more frequent and intense heatwaves as the climate warms. The German Weather Service reported that 2023 was the second-warmest year since records began in 1881, with an average temperature of 10.6 °C, which is 2.2 °C above the 1961–1990 baseline. Such extremes raise health risks, especially in dense cities. (<a href="https://www.dwd.de/DE/presse/pressemitteilungen/DE/2024/20240109_deutschlandwetter_jahr_2023_news.html">Deutscher Wetterdienst</a>)</p>
<p>Heat is a leading weather-related killer. Across Europe, the summer of 2022 alone was linked to an estimated 61,000 heat-related deaths, highlighting what is at stake if adaptation lags. (<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-023-02419-z">Nature Medicine</a>)</p>

<h2 id="🇩🇪-potential-restrictions-for-temporary-rentals">🇩🇪 Potential restrictions for temporary rentals</h2>
<p class="excerpt">Green city officials in a Berlin district want to restrict temporary furnished rentals. Green councillor Florian Schmidt argues that most advertised apartments are now rented furnished and for limited periods, often at sharply inflated prices. The district aims to prohibit this practice, including at the state-owned company Berlinovo, although it currently lacks full data on its stock. (<a href="https://checkpoint.tagesspiegel.de/langmeldung/5DfACIpbPFoqUEfS0kxFGX?utm_medium=social-button-nl-web">Tagesspiegel Checkpoint</a>)</p>
<p>In Germany’s five largest cities, furnished apartments now cost about €10 per m² more than unfurnished units. In Berlin the gap reaches €17.70, with furnished flats averaging €36.82 per m², and making up around 35 % of listings by late 2023, especially in small-unit segments. (<a href="https://www.refire-online.com/investment/bypassing-the-rent-cap-one-furnished-apartment-at-a-time/">REFIRE</a>)</p>
<p>A key driver is a legal loophole. Rentals classed as “temporary use” and “furnished” are largely exempt from rent control rules and many misappropriation limits for holiday-style sublets. Landlords can also demand loosely justified furniture surcharges, which turn regular homes into highly profitable serviced apartments.

<h2 id="🇩🇪-sick-leave-in-germany-is-increasing">🇩🇪 Sick leave in Germany is increasing</h2>
<p class="excerpt">Sick leave in Germany has risen sharply since 2021, according to data from company health insurance funds (BKK). The main causes are respiratory diseases such as Covid‑19, flu and colds, as well as mental health conditions and musculoskeletal problems like back pain or osteoarthritis. Regional gaps are large, and physically demanding jobs show especially high absence. (<a href="https://www.berliner-zeitung.de/news/krankmeldungen-in-deutschland-nehmen-deutlich-zu-das-sind-die-gruende-li.10007385">Berliner Zeitung</a>)</p>
<p>Statutory insurers reported an average of 19.4 sick days per employee in 2023, up from 18.4 in 2022 and about 15 in 2020. Respiratory infections accounted for roughly one quarter of all sick days in 2022, far above pre‑pandemic levels. (<a href="https://www.tk.de/resource/blob/2121070/0c57a82bb836d14c877514dc0390268d/tk-gesundheitsreport-2024-data.pdf">Techniker Krankenkasse</a>)</p>
<p>Mental illness has also become a major driver of long absences. In 2022, mental and behavioral disorders caused about 19.6 % of all sick days in Germany’s statutory system, although they represented a smaller share of individual cases. Average spells for depression or anxiety often exceed 30 days, which amplifies pressure on employers and social insurance.

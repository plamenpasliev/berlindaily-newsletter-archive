<h2 id="🍣-lidl-recalls-tuna-over-listeria-risk">🍣 Lidl Recalls Tuna Over Listeria Risk</h2>
<p class="excerpt">The manufacturer Sicily Food is recalling its &quot;Sansibar Deluxe Thunfisch Carpaccio&quot; sold at Lidl stores in 11 German states. The recall is due to contamination with <em>Listeria monocytogenes</em> bacteria. It affects 100g packages with use-by dates of December 27, 28, and 29, 2025. Customers can return the product for a full refund without a receipt. (<a href="https://www.rbb24.de/panorama/beitrag/2025/12/berlin-brandenburg-rueckruf-thunfisch-carpaccio-lebensmittel.html">rbb24</a>)</p>
<p><em>Listeria monocytogenes</em> is a harmful bacterium found in soil, water, and some animals, which can cause an infection called listeriosis. Unlike many other bacteria, it can survive and grow in cold temperatures, such as in a refrigerator. This makes it a particular risk for ready-to-eat chilled foods, including deli meats and soft cheeses. (<a href="https://www.fda.gov/food/foodborne-pathogens/listeria-listeriosis">U.S. Food and Drug Administration</a>)</p>
<p>This recall highlights the ongoing threat posed by listeriosis, which is rare but can be severe, especially for vulnerable populations. The danger is persistent across Europe. In 2022, the European Union reported 2,738 cases of listeriosis, which resulted in a high hospitalization rate and was the fifth most reported foodborne zoonotic disease. (<a href="https://www.efsa.europa.eu/en/topics/topic/listeria">European Food Safety Authority</a>)</p>

<h2 id="🚨-berlin-revives-emergency-call-pillars">🚨 Berlin Revives Emergency Call Pillars</h2>
<p class="excerpt">Berlin is reintroducing public emergency call pillars, starting with a pilot project in Tempelhof-Schöneberg. A modern pillar will be installed at the corner of Bülowstraße and Frobenstraße, an area known for street prostitution and drug trafficking. The project, launching in early 2026, aims to improve safety for vulnerable groups including sex workers and queer people. (<a href="https://www.rbb24.de/panorama/beitrag/2025/12/berlin-notruf-notrufsaeule-buelowstrasse-frobenstrasse-polizei.html">rbb24</a>)</p>
<p>Unlike older models, the new pillar is a high-tech security station. When activated, it transmits real-time video and audio to emergency services, illuminates its surroundings, and documents the situation. The legal basis for this enhanced surveillance was recently established through an amendment to Berlin&#39;s General Security and Order Act (ASOG), which expanded police powers. (<a href="https://www.nd-aktuell.de/artikel/1183174.asog-reform-in-berlin-ueberwachungsstaat-in-den-startloechern.html">nd-aktuell.de</a>)</p>
<p>This project suggests that despite near-universal mobile phone access, significant public safety gaps remain for the most vulnerable. A study on emergency calls found that 85% of people still unlock their phone and dial manually in a crisis. This process can be too slow or complex for individuals experiencing extreme stress or who do not have a functioning phone.

<h2 id="💰-berlin-boosts-enforcement-against-illegal-rents">💰 Berlin Boosts Enforcement Against Illegal Rents</h2>
<p class="excerpt">Berlin&#39;s CDU and SPD coalition is allocating an additional €4.5 million to combat excessive rents. The funds will support up to 19 new staff positions for rent supervision across the city&#39;s districts. A new online portal is also planned, allowing residents to report suspected violations of rent control laws directly to authorities. (<a href="https://www.tagesspiegel.de/uberhohte-mieten-in-berlin-cdu-und-spd-planen-meldeportal-fur-verdachtsfalle-15039897.html">Tagesspiegel</a>)</p>
<p>The new measures address a rental market under severe strain. Berlin, a city where approximately 84% of households are renters, is facing a significant housing crisis. Median asking rents across the city increased by a staggering 21.2% in 2023 alone, as the demand for housing continues to far outpace the available supply. (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/jan/22/berlin-housing-crisis-germany-rents-flats">The Guardian</a>)</p>
<p>This initiative highlights that Berlin&#39;s rent control laws are frequently ineffective without active enforcement. Despite the rent brake&#39;s existence, widespread non-compliance undermines its purpose, leaving tenants to navigate a market where illegal rents are common. A recent analysis by the German Tenants&#39; Association found that 46% of apartment listings in Berlin exceeded the legally permitted rent.

<h2 id="🙂-the-bright-side-of-berlin">🙂 The Bright Side of Berlin</h2>
<p>Today’s story comes from reader <strong>Roger K.</strong>, who shared a moment of quick thinking and teamwork in the Spandau U-Bahn:</p>
<p>&quot;One morning I entered the station and noticed heavy smoke coming out of a metal trash bin, presumably from a cigarette thrown in there. I ran to the underground kiosk to buy a bottle of water to put it out.</p>
<p>When the shopkeeper asked if I was buying the water for the fire, I said yes. Instead of selling it to me, he gave me the water for free, which I used to extinguish the flames.&quot;</p>

<h2 id="❄️-german-soldiers-exit-greenland-early-following-tariff-threats">❄️ German Soldiers Exit Greenland Early Following Tariff Threats</h2>
<p class="excerpt">A 15-member German military team left Greenland on Sunday, ending a brief deployment that began Friday. The experts arrived in Nuuk at Denmark&#39;s invitation to scout for future NATO exercises. While Bild called the withdrawal a &quot;secret&quot; order from Berlin, the Ministry of Defense stated the mission was successfully completed. (<a href="https://www.spiegel.de/politik/deutschland/groenland-bundeswehrsoldaten-ziehen-schon-wieder-ab-a-d157ced3-20b3-4ba9-b363-47be1cac2b55">Der Spiegel</a>)</p>
<p>The withdrawal coincided with U.S. President Donald Trump&#39;s Saturday announcement of a 10% tariff on eight European nations, effective February 1. Trump aims to pressure Denmark into selling the mineral-rich territory. He described the European troop presence as &quot;dangerous,&quot; warning that tariffs will rise to 25% by June unless he acquires the island. (<a href="https://www.dw.com/en/greenland-row-german-military-ends-short-deployment/live-75550031">dw.com</a>)</p>
<p>European leaders rejected Trump’s &quot;blackmail,&quot; with France urging the use of the EU’s Anti-Coercion Instrument. A joint statement from the targeted nations reaffirmed their solidarity with Danish sovereignty. While Germany’s team has returned for analysis, Denmark and France continue efforts to bolster Arctic security, refusing to let trade policy dictate territorial integrity.

<h2 id="✈️-berlin-gangs-recruiting-foreign-criminals">✈️ Berlin Gangs Recruiting Foreign Criminals</h2>
<p class="excerpt">Organized crime syndicates in Berlin are recruiting young men from abroad to carry out violent threats and extortion. These perpetrators often enter Germany on short-term tourist visas, execute specific criminal contracts, and leave quickly. Police Chief Barbara Slowik Meisel noted that many recruits speak little German and serve bosses located both locally and overseas. (<a href="https://www.dw.com/en/germany-news-merz-to-host-syrian-leader-despite-criticism/live-75545809">dw.com</a>)</p>
<p>Berlin saw a significant surge in gang-related violence during 2025, including a December incident where a hand grenade was thrown into a pub. The violence is driven by territorial drug &quot;turf wars&quot; and aggressive extortion rackets targeting business owners. Gangs have increasingly resorted to firing shots at buildings to enforce their financial demands. (<a href="https://www.spiegel.de/panorama/justiz/berlin-banden-lassen-taeter-fuer-straftaten-aus-dem-ausland-einfliegen-a-3b84cdba-6da7-4dbd-a034-e3cf74985d62">Der Spiegel</a>)</p>
<p>Berlin’s police leadership is calling for legislative reforms to expand surveillance capabilities against organized crime. Chief Meisel argues that discovering an illegal firearm should provide sufficient grounds for immediate telephone monitoring and observation. Currently, legal restrictions often limit officers to simple weapons charges, preventing deeper investigations into the criminal structures behind the perpetrators. (<a href="https://www.berliner-zeitung.de/news/bandenkaempfe-in-berlin-taeter-werden-laut-polizei-extra-aus-dem-ausland-eingeflogen-li.10014616">Berliner Zeitung</a>)</p>

<h2 id="📉-merz-questions-high-german-sick-leave-rates">📉 Merz questions high German sick leave rates</h2>
<p class="excerpt">German Chancellor Friedrich Merz criticized the country&#39;s high sick leave rates during a campaign event in Baden-Württemberg, questioning if 14.5 days off annually is necessary. Merz argued that the current economic climate demands higher performance and suggested reviewing policies that allow doctors to issue sick notes via telephone. (<a href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/almost-three-weeks-germanys-merz-124320607.html">Yahoo</a>)</p>
<p>A central target of Merz&#39;s critique is the telephone sick leave policy introduced in 2021 during the coronavirus pandemic. While conservatives argue this facilitates absenteeism, the AOK health insurance fund disputes this, attributing statistical increases in lost days primarily to the recent implementation of comprehensive electronic reporting systems. (<a href="https://www.badische-zeitung.de/wirklich-notwendig-merz-kritisiert-hohen-krankenstand-x1x">Badische Zeitung</a>)</p>
<p>This debate highlights friction within the coalition, as the agreement between the Union and SPD only pledges to correct misuse of telephone consultations. While business leaders advocate for stricter wage continuation rules to reduce absenteeism, medical associations warn that requiring in-person visits for minor illnesses would overwhelm practices.

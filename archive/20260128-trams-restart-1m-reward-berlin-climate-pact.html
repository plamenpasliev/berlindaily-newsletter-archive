<h2 id="🥶-berlin-trams-restart-after-freezing-rain-shutdown">🥶 Berlin Trams Restart After Freezing Rain Shutdown</h2>
<p class="excerpt">Berlin&#39;s tram network began resuming operations Tuesday after freezing rain caused a complete shutdown of the system earlier in the week. BVG restored service on key Metro lines following extensive manual de-icing efforts. While some lines like the M1 and M5 have returned to partial service, officials warned that irregular schedules and cancellations remain likely through Wednesday. (<a href="https://www.berliner-zeitung.de/news/winter-in-berlin-strassenbahnen-fahren-bis-mittag-nicht-einschraenkungen-bei-bussen-li.10016074">Berliner Zeitung</a>)</p>
<p>The severe weather event coated the city&#39;s infrastructure in ice, causing nearly 40 ice-related injury admissions at the Accident Hospital (UKB) within 24 hours. While the underground U2 line briefly halted due to glowing electrical isolators, falling ice forced police to restrict access in the area around the TV Tower. Crews must now manually clear the overhead lines to restore full power. (<a href="https://www.tagesspiegel.de/berlin/eis-chaos-in-berlin-mehrere-tramlinien-und-u2-fahren-wieder--bereich-am-fernsehturm-zwischenzeitlich-abgesperrt-15185307.html">Tagesspiegel</a>)</p>
<p>Critics argue the shutdown highlights a lack of infrastructure resilience, noting that neighboring Potsdam successfully maintained service by using glycerin on wires. The BVG defended the disruption as the result of a weather event not seen in decades, though officials could not provide a concrete timeline for a full return to normal schedules. (<a href="https://www.welt.de/vermischtes/article6978aa7c421b9660fac243c5/winter-in-der-hauptstadt-komplett-vom-oepnv-abgeschnitten-wie-kann-es-sein-dass-in-berlin-die-trams-zwei-tage-ausfallen.html">WELT</a>)</p>

<h2 id="⚡-germany-offers-€1m-reward-for-berlin-grid-arson">⚡ Germany Offers €1M Reward for Berlin Grid Arson</h2>
<p class="excerpt">German federal authorities have announced a record €1 million reward for information leading to the perpetrators of an arson attack on Berlin’s power grid. Interior Minister Alexander Dobrindt confirmed the bounty on Tuesday, targeting the suspects behind the January 3 sabotage that left approximately 45,000 households and 2,200 businesses without electricity. (<a href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/germany-offers-1-mn-euro-102820536.html">Yahoo</a>)</p>
<p>Police are hunting members of the far-left &quot;Vulkangruppe&quot; (Volcano Group), who claimed responsibility for setting fire to high-voltage cables in southwest Berlin. The resulting outage lasted nearly a week during freezing winter temperatures, marking the capital&#39;s longest blackout since World War II. Domestic intelligence reports indicate politically motivated left-wing crime rose 38% in 2024. (<a href="https://www.usnews.com/news/world/articles/2026-01-27/germany-plans-crackdown-on-far-left-militants-after-berlin-power-grid-attack">U.S. News &amp; World Report</a>)</p>
<p>This historic financial incentive underlines the severity of infrastructure vulnerabilities, as Berlin Interior Senator Iris Spranger described the sum as a &quot;one-off case&quot; without federal precedent. In response, officials are fast-tracking legislation to expand police powers, including automated data analysis and biometric facial recognition, to better protect critical facilities from future sabotage.

<h2 id="🌿-berlin-firms-sign-€138-billion-climate-pact">🌿 Berlin Firms Sign €13.8 Billion Climate Pact</h2>
<p class="excerpt">Berlin&#39;s coalition government and 22 state-owned companies signed a historic climate pact committing €13.8 billion toward environmental protection measures by 2030. The city senate will provide an additional €2.3 billion to help these firms significantly reduce their carbon emissions by 70% compared to 1990 levels. (<a href="https://www.rbb24.de/politik/beitrag/2026/01/berlin-klimapakt-landeseigene-unternehmen-klimaschutz.html">rbb24</a>)</p>
<p>New funds will modernize infrastructure, including 450 new electric buses for the BVG transport authority and extensive upgrades to the high-voltage electrical grid. However, households will shoulder some costs, with water fees expected to rise by nearly €1 monthly and district heating prices projected to increase significantly starting in 2027. (<a href="https://www.bz-berlin.de/berlin/mitte/berlin-klimapakt-kosten-kunden">bz-berlin.de</a>)</p>
<p>Economic Senator Franziska Giffey described this initiative as a massive effort requiring the elimination of 7.2 million tonnes of CO2 within six years. Success depends heavily on the heating sector, as the local energy utility currently generates 25% of the capital&#39;s emissions, though environmental groups argue the plan lacks binding transport policies.

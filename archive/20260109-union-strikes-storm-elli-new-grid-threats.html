<h2 id="📢-unions-announce-two-day-public-sector-strikes">📢 Unions Announce Two-Day Public Sector Strikes</h2>
<p class="excerpt">Major trade unions have called for public sector warning strikes in Berlin and Brandenburg on January 14 and 15. Verdi, GEW, GdP, and IG Bau are mobilizing employees in schools, universities, police stations, and fire departments. While school staff will walk out on Wednesday, university and daycare centers face disruptions on both days. (<a href="https://www.rbb24.de/wirtschaft/beitrag/2026/01/warnstreik-verdi-gew-gdp-ig-bau-schulen-unis-polizei-feuerwehr-kitas.html">rbb24</a>)</p>
<p>These actions are timed to coincide with the second round of collective bargaining in Potsdam on January 15 and 16. The unions are demanding a salary increase of seven percent for state employees, with a minimum raise of 300 euros for lower wage groups. They also want the new contract to last twelve months. (<a href="https://www.morgenpost.de/berlin/article410880112/streik-hammer-trifft-berlin-mit-voller-wucht-wann-es-losgeht.html">Berliner Morgenpost</a>)</p>
<p>Past participation figures suggest significant local impact. During a similar action in December, 18 state-run daycares closed completely while 90 others reduced operations. Roughly 1,000 teachers participated last month, though about 12,000 of Berlin’s 35,000 teachers hold civil servant status and are legally prohibited from striking.

<h2 id="🌨️-storm-elli-brings-extreme-winter-weather">🌨️ Storm Elli Brings Extreme Winter Weather</h2>
<p class="excerpt">Storm &quot;Elli&quot; is approaching Berlin and Brandenburg, bringing severe winter conditions that officials have classified as an &quot;extreme situation&quot; for Friday. The German Weather Service forecasts up to 15 centimeters of fresh snow, strong easterly winds, and freezing rain. Residents are urged to stay indoors, as wind gusts up to 60 kilometers per hour may cause dangerous snowdrifts. (<a href="https://www.rbb24.de/panorama/beitrag/2026/01/sturmtief-elli-extreme-wetterlage-schneeverwehungen.html">rbb24</a>)</p>
<p>Transport infrastructure is bracing for significant disruptions throughout the region. Berlin Brandenburg Airport (BER) warned passengers to expect flight delays and cancellations due to the massive winter onset. Meanwhile, Deutsche Bahn has cancelled some regional connections and reduced high-speed train velocities, while the local BVG transit authority activated switch heaters to keep the metro system running despite the freeze. (<a href="https://www.berlin.de/en/news/10125484-5559700-winter-storm-on-friday-german-weather-se.en.html">berlin.de</a>)</p>
<p>Public life is slowing down as institutions prioritize safety. Berlin and Brandenburg authorities suspended compulsory school attendance for Friday, allowing parents to decide whether to keep children home. Additionally, the Berlin Zoo and Tierpark announced they will remain closed to protect both animals and visitors from falling branches, a risk exacerbated by the heavy snow load on old trees. (<a href="https://www.tagesspiegel.de/berlin/glatte-strassen-und-massenhaft-schnee-berlin-wappnet-sich-fur-wintersturmtief-elli--unfallkrankenhaus-bereits-uberfullt-15115252.html">Tagesspiegel</a>)</p>

<h2 id="🔦-berlin-power-restored-amid-new-grid-threats">🔦 Berlin Power Restored Amid New Grid Threats</h2>
<p>Power was fully restored to nearly 50,000 households in Berlin following a suspected arson attack on high-voltage cables that plunged the city’s southwest into darkness for five days. Authorities confirmed the sabotage, which left residents without heat during freezing temperatures, finally ended Wednesday afternoon after extensive repairs were completed by grid technicians. (<a href="https://tribune.com.pk/story/2586044/berlin-power-restored-after-blackout">The Express Tribune</a>)</p>
<p>A far-left extremist network known as the &quot;Volcano Group&quot; claimed responsibility for the arson, citing environmental motives and opposition to fossil fuels. However, investigators face conflicting narratives after a separate faction claiming to be the original founders publicly disavowed the attack, stating they ceased operations years ago to avoid harming civilians. (<a href="https://www.berliner-kurier.de/news/stromausfall-jetzt-will-es-keiner-gewesen-sein-li.10013070">Berliner Kurier</a>)</p>
<p>As insurers begin processing claims for spoiled food and frozen pipes, security officials are analyzing a new threat targeting East Berlin’s Marzahn district. While the initial blackout has concluded, authorities remain on high alert regarding critical infrastructure, warning that the &quot;Volcano Group&quot; label is likely used loosely by independent anarchist cells.

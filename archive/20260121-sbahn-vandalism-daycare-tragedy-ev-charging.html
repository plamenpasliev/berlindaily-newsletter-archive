<h2 id="🚦-s-bahn-disrupted-by-cable-vandalism">🚦 S-Bahn Disrupted by Cable Vandalism</h2>
<p class="excerpt">Thousands of commuters in Berlin must endure significant travel delays and cancellations after vandals damaged critical signaling infrastructure on the S-Bahn network. Services on lines S1, S2, S25, S26, and S85 remain severely restricted between Gesundbrunnen and Nordbahnhof until full operations are scheduled to resume Thursday at 3:30 a.m. A temporary shuttle train is currently running every 20 minutes between Bornholmer Straße and Nordbahnhof. (<a href="https://www.berliner-kurier.de/berlin/kabeldiebe-bremsen-berliner-s-bahn-bis-donnerstagfrueh-aus-li.10014955">Berliner Kurier</a>)</p>
<p>Federal police are investigating the incident as a particularly severe case of theft after three signal cables were cut and several meters of material were stolen. While public speculation has linked the destruction to political sabotage groups, authorities stated there is currently no evidence suggesting an ideologically motivated attack. (<a href="https://www.rbb24.de/panorama/beitrag/2026/01/berlin-verspaetungen-s-bahn-signalstoerung-gesundbrunnen.html">rbb24.de</a>)</p>
<p>This disruption exposes the security challenges facing Berlin&#39;s 340-kilometer rail system, which officials admit cannot be fully monitored around the clock. The vandalism compounds recent infrastructure struggles, occurring just weeks after a separate fire at the Wedding station caused structural damage that will take later this year to fully repair. (<a href="https://www.berliner-zeitung.de/mensch-metropole/zerstoertes-glasfaserkabel-legt-s-bahn-verkehr-lahm-hat-die-vulkangruppe-wieder-zugeschlagen-li.10015007">Berliner Zeitung</a>)</p>

<h2 id="🕯️-daycare-tragedy-5-year-old-killed-by-falling-door">🕯️ Daycare Tragedy: 5-Year-Old Killed by Falling Door</h2>
<p class="excerpt">A five-year-old boy died Monday following a tragic accident at a daycare center in the Niederschöneweide district of Berlin. Police confirmed that a heavy terrace door fell on the child around 10:15 a.m., causing fatal injuries despite immediate resuscitation attempts by emergency responders at the scene in the Treptow-Köpenick borough. (<a href="https://www.tagesschau.de/inland/regional/berlin/rbb-treptow-koepenick-kind-stirbt-bei-unfall-in-berliner-kita-100.html">tagesschau.de</a>)</p>
<p>The massive glass door reportedly tore from its hinges and collapsed inward into a room, striking the young boy. Eleven firefighters and emergency doctors rushed to the facility on Adlergestell, while two helicopters landed nearby to assist the rescue operation involving extensive medical teams trying to save him. (<a href="https://www.bild.de/regional/berlin/unglueck-in-kita-in-berlin-junge-5-von-terrassentuer-erschlagen-696e4544a4073dd2f97f6d68">BILD</a>)</p>
<p>The daycare will remain shut until Wednesday as investigators analyze the site to ensure such a tragedy cannot happen again. District Mayor Oliver Igel (SPD) stated that authorities must do everything possible to prevent a recurrence, pledging full support for the grieving family and the affected school community.

<h2 id="⚡-real-time-map-for-ev-charging-prices">⚡ Real-Time Map for EV Charging Prices</h2>
<p class="excerpt">Berlin&#39;s transport administration has launched a new digital map displaying real-time data for electric vehicle (EV) charging stations. The &quot;E-Informationsplattform&quot; allows drivers to locate approximately 3,000 public charging points while viewing current availability and specific ad-hoc pricing costs without needing a subscription. This initiative supports the owners of approximately 100,000 electric vehicles currently registered in Berlin. (<a href="https://www.tagesspiegel.de/berlin/digitale-hilfe-fur-berliner-autofahrer-alle-e-ladepunkte-mit-preisen-nun-auf-einer-karte-15157448.html">Tagesspiegel</a>)</p>
<p>The current dataset contains about 80% of the capital&#39;s on-street infrastructure, aggregating data from the three largest providers: Berliner Stadtwerke, Qwello, and Ubitricity. While the city currently hosts 15 different infrastructure operators to prevent monopolies, the remaining smaller providers will be integrated into the system throughout the year. (<a href="https://www.electrive.net/2026/01/20/berlin-startet-neue-uebersichtskarte-mit-ladestationen-und-preisen/">electrive.net</a>)</p>
<p>Although Berlin contains over 6,000 publicly accessible charging options, this tool specifically targets the 3,500 units located directly in public street spaces rather than private lots like supermarkets. The platform plans to eventually update the map with crucial details regarding station accessibility features and specific parking spot dimensions.

<p>Staying on top of German bureaucracy is not easy. I personally recommend Feather because they’ve built a transparent, English-first platform specifically for expats.</p>
<p>In Germany, you are legally responsible for accidental damage to others. &quot;Liability&quot; insurance protects you against that. &quot;Household&quot; protects your belongings from theft or water damage (which happens more often than you&#39;d think in Altbau apartments). <strong>3 out of 4 of households in Germany have those voluntary insurances.</strong> &quot;Legal&quot; gives you peace of mind that you can handle rental or employment disputes without facing thousands of euros in lawyer fees.</p>
<p>Feather provides you insurance management and comparisons. If you’re looking for peace of mind, they makes it simple. <strong><a href="https://feather-insurance.com/?utm_source=berlindaily&amp;utm_medium=newsletter&amp;utm_campaign=intro">Check out their policies</a></strong>.</p>

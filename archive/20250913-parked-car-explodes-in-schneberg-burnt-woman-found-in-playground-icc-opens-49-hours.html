     <h1 id="🌤️-guten-morgen-berlin">🌤️ Guten Morgen, Berlin!</h1>
<p>Here’s your quick update on what’s happening around the city on Saturday, September 13 - from urgent alerts to stories in the subreddit. Today we went through 100+ articles, posts and events so you don&#39;t have to. Let’s dive in.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="🇩🇪-there-was-a-murderous-bang-car-explodes-directly-in-front-of-22-year-old-in-suspected-attack---residents-report">🇩🇪 &quot;There was a murderous bang&quot; Car explodes directly in front of 22-year-old in suspected attack - residents report</h2>
<p class="excerpt">A parked car exploded in Berlin’s Schöneberg overnight, seriously injuring a 22-year-old man; police and prosecutors say he survived because he wasn’t inside or next to it.  </p>
<p>Authorities believe it was a targeted attack and opened an attempted murder investigation. The blast scattered debris across Ebersstrasse, prompting a wide cordon near schools and transit stations.  </p>
<p>Police are conducting forensic analysis to determine how the device was placed and to identify suspects; expect continued road closures and heightened patrols in the area as the probe continues.

<h2 id="🇩🇪-burnt-woman-found-in-childrens-playground">🇩🇪 Burnt woman found in children&#39;s playground</h2>
<p>Berlin police found a burned woman dead at a playground in Volkspark Humboldthain Friday morning and arrested a 49-year-old man at the scene.</p>
<p>Investigators said the injuries and discovery circumstances do not rule out foul play, and the homicide squad and prosecutors are leading the case.</p>
<p>An autopsy is scheduled for Friday afternoon, with results expected Saturday, when authorities will determine whether to request an arrest warrant for the detained man.

<p>Berlin’s International Congress Center (ICC) opens to the public for 49 hours Sept. 12–14, offering tours, film screenings, fitness sessions, and rare access to previously closed Hall 2.</p>
<p>The 1979 landmark has sat largely unused for over a decade due to aging systems and asbestos. Interest remains high, with 700,000 site visits chasing 30,000 free tickets, amid signals this could be the last look at its original interiors.</p>
<p>Berlin is running a concept competition to select a private investor, with a decision expected by summer 2026, potentially leading to extensive refurbishment or redevelopment.

<p>⚽ <strong>Fun Fact:</strong> Berlin’s football club <strong>Hertha BSC</strong> (founded 1892) was named after a <em>boat</em>! One of the founders had taken a trip on a steamship called Hertha with his dad – and the club adopted the boat’s name (and its blue-and-white colors).</p>

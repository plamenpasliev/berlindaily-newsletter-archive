<h2 id="🇩🇪-terror-threats-against-schools-on-sunday">🇩🇪 Terror threats against schools on Sunday</h2>
<p class="excerpt">Berlin experienced a wave of terror panic on Sunday and Monday after a YouTuber spread an unverified claim about planned attacks on 20 schools. Instead of alerting police and waiting for clarification, he shared the rumor publicly, triggering citywide anxiety and highlighting how emotional reactions and online reach can amplify false information. (<a href="https://www.tagesspiegel.de/berlin/nach-terrordrohung-gegen-schulen-gilt-dont-panic-berlin-muss-falschinformationen-besser-ignorieren-lernen-14889227.html">Tagesspiegel</a>)</p>
<p>The incident comes amid growing concern about disinformation and social media in Germany. The latest D21-Digital-Index reports that only 49% of Germans have at least basic digital skills, far below the EU target of 80% by 2030, despite more than 80% being able to search for information online. (<a href="https://initiatived21.de/publikationen/d21-digital-index/2024-25/executive-summary">Initiative D21</a>)</p>
<p>This incident underscores how an open information society depends on citizens to stay calm and check implausible claims before sharing them. That requires both personal judgment and systemic support. In a recent survey, 89.9% of Germans said fake news threatens democracy and freedom, and 65.1% see social platforms as mainly responsible for combating it. (<a href="https://www.iu.de/forschung/studien/medienkompetenz/">IU Internationale Hochschule</a>)</p>

<h2 id="🇩🇪-görlitzer-park-in-berlin-acting-without-labeling">🇩🇪 Görlitzer Park in Berlin: Acting without labeling</h2>
<p class="excerpt">Activists from the initiative Görli 24/7 have accused an anonymous security team with aggressive dogs of patrolling Berlin’s Görlitzer Park since late October. They say at least one visitor was bitten. The Senate says state company Grün Berlin hired the guards to protect the controversial new fence construction after a turnstile theft, and that work continues as planned. (<a href="https://taz.de/Goerlitzer-Park-in-Berlin/!6131117/">taz</a>)</p>
<p>Görlitzer Park is officially classified by Berlin police as a “crime‑ridden area.” From 2021 to August 2023, officers recorded around 4,100 offences there, roughly as many as in all other city parks combined. In 2022 alone, police logged 1,567 crimes, including about 700 drug trafficking cases and nearly 90 robberies. (<a href="https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6rlitzer_Park">Wikipedia</a>)</p>
<p>The Görlitzer Park dispute shows how security outsourcing can blur legal responsibility and public accountability. It also illustrates a wider German trend toward more private guarding of public places. In January 2025, official data showed nearly 290,000 people employed in Germany’s private security industry, with steady annual growth linked to rising safety concerns. (<a href="https://euro-security.de/en/almost-290000-people-employed-in-the-private-security-industry/">Euro Security</a>)</p>

<h2 id="🇩🇪-charging-as-easy-as-refueling-new-plan-from-the-german-government">🇩🇪 Charging as easy as refueling: New plan from the German government</h2>
<p class="excerpt">The German federal government has adopted a “Charging Infrastructure Master Plan 2030” that aims to make charging an electric car as simple as refuelling. The plan targets easier payment processes, greater price transparency, and clearer rules for public charging. It also foresees funding for chargers in multi-party buildings and depots, subject to tight budget conditions. (<a href="https://www.heise.de/news/Laden-so-einfach-wie-Tanken-Neuer-Plan-der-Bundesregierung-11085212.html">heise online</a>)</p>
<p>Germany’s charging network has grown rapidly but coverage and capacity remain uneven. A VDA industry ranking found that on 1 July 2025 about 2.88 million electric and plug‑in hybrid cars shared 172,150 public chargers, or 16.7 vehicles per point, with 32 % of German municipalities lacking any public charger. The association warns that slow build‑out undermines confidence in everyday e‑mobility. (<a href="https://www.vda.de/de/themen/elektromobilitaet/ladenetz-ranking/ladenetz-ranking-ueberblick">VDA</a>)</p>
<p>The initiative shows that Germany sees consumer trust as crucial for its climate transport goals. A survey for the federal consumer association found that 84 % of respondents consider transparent, uniform public charging prices decisive for switching to electric mobility.

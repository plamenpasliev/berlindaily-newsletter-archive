<h2 id="🇩🇪-degree-without-a-connection-career-starters-with-a-degree-have-a-hard-time">🇩🇪 Degree without a connection: Career starters with a degree have a hard time</h2>
<p class="excerpt">Many German graduates are finding first jobs harder to land than vocational peers, rbb24 reports. Alisa Sogijaine sent 40–50 applications before securing a trainee role at energy provider Edis, where applications per opening have doubled. Entry-level postings for academics fell 43.9% in Berlin and 54.7% in Brandenburg; young graduate unemployment also rose. (<a href="https://www.rbb24.de/wirtschaft/beitrag/2025/10/berufseinsteiger-mit-studium-haben-es-schwer-arbeitsmarkt.html">rbb24</a>)</p>
<p>National demand helps explain the squeeze. In September 2025, employers reported 630,000 vacancies to the Federal Employment Agency, down 66,000 year on year. The agency’s job index stood at 98, unchanged from August and signaling subdued hiring appetite compared with stronger years, which limits direct-entry opportunities for new graduates. (<a href="https://www.arbeitsagentur.de/presse/2025-41-arbeitsmarkt-im-september-2025">Bundesagentur für Arbeit</a>)</p>
<p>Supply of graduates is also rising. Germany awarded about 511,600 higher-education degrees in the 2024 exam year, 1.9% more than in 2023. Fields with the most graduates were law, economics, and social sciences at 41%, followed by engineering at 25%. More graduates in these tracks intensify competition for junior roles and traineeships.

<h2 id="🇬🇧-german-dentists-hold-memorial-recognising-sadistic-practices-of-profession-under-nazis">🇬🇧 German dentists hold memorial recognising sadistic practices of profession under Nazis</h2>
<p class="excerpt">Germany’s main dental society held its first memorial on Wednesday, acknowledging “systemic” involvement of dentists in Nazi crimes. At Humboldt University, speakers detailed sadistic extractions, experiments, forced sterilizations and murders. Research cited 55% of dentists and over 60% of dental academics joining the party, with some aiding camp “selections” (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/oct/30/german-dentists-memorial-recognising-sadistic-practices-under-nazis">The Guardian</a>)</p>
<p>Historians long ago documented broad medical complicity. Roughly half of all German physicians joined Nazi Party organizations between 1933 and 1945, far above typical professions. Many embraced eugenics and directly supported persecution, benefiting from the dismissal of Jewish colleagues and the “Aryanization” of medicine. They influenced policy and practice (<a href="https://encyclopedia.ushmm.org/narrative/62293/en">United States Holocaust Memorial Museum</a>)</p>
<p>The dental society’s reckoning signals how professional gatekeepers can fortify ethical norms and resist resurgent hatred. Such public accountability matters amid today’s tensions. A national watchdog counted 8,627 antisemitic incidents in Germany in 2024, nearly double the prior year, underscoring the urgency of credible, proactive institutional responses (<a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/antisemitic-incidents-germany-almost-double-2024-report-says-2025-06-04/">Reuters</a>)</p>

<h2 id="🇩🇪-energy-sharing-act-sharing-electricity-with-neighbors">🇩🇪 Energy Sharing Act: Sharing electricity with neighbors?</h2>
<p class="excerpt">Germany leads the European Union in solar expansion, including private rooftops, but surplus power often goes unused. A government bill would let producers share electricity with neighbors through local “energy communities” from 2026. A Bakum pilot suggested local needs could be fully covered; however, critics warn the draft lacks subsidies and clarity. (<a href="https://www.tagesschau.de/wissen/technologie/energie-strom-energy-sharing-100.html">tagesschau.de</a>)</p>
<p>Under European Union law, “energy sharing” means active customers self‑consume renewable electricity generated or stored off‑site or transferred by another customer. Member states must let shared output be netted against metered use and exempt small households from supplier duties, with thresholds of up to 10.8 kilowatts for single homes. (<a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/dir/2019/944/2024-07-16/eng">EUR‑Lex</a>)</p>
<p>If Germany pairs clear rules with simple digital billing, neighborhood sharing could turn rooftop surpluses into cheaper, more resilient local power and support the grid. Evidence indicates real savings are possible: a Deutsche Energie-Agentur simulation found peer‑to‑peer electricity markets can cut household bills by about 4 percent locally and up to 20 percent nationally.

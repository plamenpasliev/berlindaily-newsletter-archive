<h2 id="🇩🇪-why-transit-apps-are-sometimes-incorrect">🇩🇪 Why transit apps are sometimes incorrect</h2>
<p class="excerpt">A report from rbb24 describes how Berlin and Brandenburg passengers regularly receive incorrect real time information from public transport apps. The apps, including BVG, S-Bahn and Google Maps, all use data from the Verkehrsverbund Berlin-Brandenburg, which aggregates timetable and punctuality data from 37 companies. Manual data entry during disruptions often causes errors and ghost vehicles. (<a href="https://www.rbb24.de/panorama/beitrag/2025/11/fahrplanauskunft-app-online-bvg-s-bahn-vbb-berlin-brandenburg.html">rbb24</a>)</p>
<p>The scale of Berlin’s rail network magnifies the impact of bad data. S-Bahn Berlin alone carried about 456 million passengers in 2024, after an estimated 473 million in 2023, making it Germany’s busiest S-Bahn system. Demand rebounded to near pre‑pandemic levels in late 2024, increasing reliance on accurate digital information. (<a href="https://sbahn.berlin/das-unternehmen/presse/pressemitteilungen-pressearchiv/pressemitteilungen/fast-eine-halbe-milliarde-menschen-fahren-mit-der-berliner-s-bahn/">S-Bahn Berlin</a>)</p>
<p>Despite passenger frustrations, punctuality statistics remain relatively strong. In 2023, 96.6 % of Berlin S-Bahn trains met the operator’s on‑time definition, compared with a national S‑Bahn average of 92.5 %. BVG buses and trams were less reliable, with punctuality at 88.6 % and 87.1 % respectively, and showing a downward trend over recent years.

<h2 id="🇩🇪-chat-with-drug-dealers-using-a-qr-code">🇩🇪 Chat with drug dealers using a QR code</h2>
<p class="excerpt">In Berlin, drug dealers are increasingly advertising via colorful QR-code stickers on lampposts, ATMs, train doors, and in club districts. Scanning them opens WhatsApp or Telegram chats that offer cannabis, cocaine, ketamine, and amphetamines, with rapid courier delivery even into Brandenburg. Berlin police know the method since 2024 but face legal and technical barriers to investigations. (<a href="https://www.tagesschau.de/inland/regional/berlin/rbb-neue-verkaufsmasche-in-berlin-per-qr-code-zum-chat-mit-drogendealern-100.html">tagesschau.de</a>)</p>
<p>This new QR code tactic is happening in an environment where drug use is already common. A national survey for 2024 found that 9.8% of adults used cannabis in the last year, while 1% were dependent on it. Dependence rates for amphetamines and cocaine were each 0.1%, showing smaller but significant user groups for the substances now advertised via QR codes. (<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40956679/">PubMed</a>)</p>
<p>The stickers show how street‑level dealing is merging with digital platforms, complicating law enforcement while exposing users to new risks. Criminals are already abusing QR codes for broader fraud. In Thuringia alone, authorities logged 38 “quishing” cases in late 2024, causing at least €60,000 in damage through fake payment QR codes on machines and notices.

<h2 id="🇩🇪-berlin-ai-start-up-relieves-nursing-staff">🇩🇪 Berlin AI start-up relieves nursing staff</h2>
<p class="excerpt">A Berlin nursing home run by Caritas has replaced much of its paper documentation with the AI voice assistant Voize. Instead of pushing a heavy medication trolley and sorting folders for 90 residents, staff now speak observations and vital signs into smartphones. The system structures entries automatically, saving about 1.5 hours of admin work per day. (<a href="https://www.rbb24.de/wirtschaft/beitrag/2025/11/berlin-ki-startup-voize-pflege-assistent-pflegeheim-caritas.html">rbb24.de</a>)</p>
<p>Germany’s care system faces rising demand as the population ages. The Federal Statistical Office projects that the number of people needing long-term care will grow from about 5 million in 2021 to roughly 6.8 million by 2055, an increase of 37 %. This trend puts sustained pressure on staff and budgets. (<a href="https://www.destatis.de/EN/Press/2023/03/PE23_124_12.html">Destatis</a>)</p>
<p>The spread of systems like Voize suggests that easing administrative burdens will be central to stabilising elder care. Freeing minutes per patient can collectively offset part of the looming staff gap. The OECD stresses that improving productivity through digital technologies is essential, because ageing societies will otherwise face both care bottlenecks and higher labour market pressures.

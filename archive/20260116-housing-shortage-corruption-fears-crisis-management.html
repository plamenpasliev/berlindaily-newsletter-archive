<h2 id="🏠-berlin-faces-shortage-of-56000-apartments">🏠 Berlin Faces Shortage of 56,000 Apartments</h2>
<p class="excerpt">A new analysis by the Pestel Institute reveals a shortage of approximately 56,000 apartments in Berlin as of late 2024. Commissioned by the &quot;Social Housing&quot; alliance, the report indicates this deficit contributes to a nationwide record of 1.4 million missing homes. The demand is projected to rise significantly in coming years, exacerbating pressure on the capital&#39;s housing market. (<a href="https://www.welt.de/regionales/berlin/article6968da6e6b40895ba7f6e9fd/studie-in-berlin-fehlen-zehntausende-wohnungen.html">WELT</a>)</p>
<p>Researchers describe the situation as a &quot;social drama&quot; disproportionately affecting the young and elderly. Students now spend an average of 53% of their disposable income on rent, hampering education and training opportunities. Simultaneously, many pensioners and retiring baby boomers face &quot;city expulsion&quot; because their retirement income is insufficient to afford rising costs in metropolitan areas. (<a href="https://www.tagesspiegel.de/politik/riesenproblem-fur-junge-und-alte-menschen-14-millionen-wohnungen-fehlen-in-deutschland-15139936.html">Tagesspiegel</a>)</p>
<p>Experts warn that Berlin risks significant economic self-harm as exploding living costs deter essential workers from moving to the capital. This trajectory mirrors problems seen in Munich two decades ago, where housing shortages stifled growth. Without a drastic increase in affordable construction, the city may become too expensive for the very labor force it relies upon.

<h2 id="☕-charity-banned-over-corruption-fears">☕ Charity Banned Over Corruption Fears</h2>
<p class="excerpt">Berlin&#39;s Governing Mayor Kai Wegner has banned the &quot;Coffee Bet,&quot; a charity initiative where districts collect coffee for the homeless to trigger retail donations. Citing concerns over potential corruption and bribery, Wegner stopped the 11-district campaign. Neukölln Mayor Martin Hikel criticized the move, arguing it hurts the city’s most vulnerable residents during winter.(<a href="https://www.rbb24.de/panorama/beitrag/2026/01/berlin-wegner-kaffeewette-verbot.html">rbb24</a>)</p>
<p>The conflict escalated after Friedrichshain-Kreuzberg raised corruption concerns, leading the Senate to deny necessary permits. Consequently, participating retailers withdrew their financial pledges to avoid reputational damage and online harassment. Despite the ban on the betting element, local officials and homeless shelters emphasize that the need for coffee remains urgent as winter temperatures drop.(<a href="https://www.tagesspiegel.de/berlin/spenden-fur-hoffest-sind-moglich--aber-nicht-fur-obdachlose-neukollns-burgermeister-hikel-kritisiert-kai-wegner-scharf-15140224.html">Tagesspiegel</a>)</p>
<p>Campaign founder Michael Lind expressed devastation, denying claims that the initiative served as personal advertising. While the Senate suggested districts could still collect coffee without business involvement, the formal &quot;bet&quot; structure is dead. Stunned by the accusations, Lind is considering returning city honors, while several districts vow to continue collecting donations independently.(<a href="https://www.morgenpost.de/berlin/article410943432/kaffeewette-erfinder-michael-lind-warum-wird-so-etwas-gutes-kaputt-gemacht.html">Berliner Morgenpost</a>)</p>

<h2 id="🐻-mayor-defends-blackout-crisis-management">🐻 Mayor Defends Blackout Crisis Management</h2>
<p class="excerpt">Berlin Mayor Kai Wegner has faced criticism after it was reported that he played tennis with Education Senator Katharina Günther-Wünsch during a major power outage affecting 100,000 residents. Public scrutiny intensified because Wegner initially stated he was working from home during the crisis. Critics have questioned the Mayor’s transparency and his decision-making during the emergency.(<a href="https://www.berliner-kurier.de/berlin/kai-wegner-bleibt-im-ausreden-modus-li.10014195">Berliner Kurier</a>)</p>
<p>Mayor Wegner described the infrastructure attack as a “terrorist turning point,” vowing to transform Berlin into a model city for crisis resilience. His proposed plan includes redistributing billions in funds for increased surveillance and infrastructure security. While admitting he should have disclosed his sport break sooner, Wegner insisted his focus remained on restoring power for the city. (<a href="https://www.tagesspiegel.de/berlin/ja-das-krisenmanagement-hat-funktioniert-kai-wegner-gibt-regierungserklarung-zu-stromausfall-ab-15139161.html">Tagesspiegel</a>)</p>
<p>Recent polls show 66% of residents rate the Senate&#39;s crisis management poorly, with 61% believing Wegner’s credibility is permanently damaged. Beyond the political fallout, 60% of Berliners admitted they are &quot;not at all&quot; or &quot;poorly&quot; prepared for similar infrastructure emergencies. This data underscores a widening gap between official security rhetoric and the actual readiness of the city&#39;s public.

<h2 id="❄️-freezing-rain-chaos-paralyzes-berlin-airport-operations">❄️ Freezing Rain Chaos Paralyzes Berlin Airport Operations</h2>
<p class="excerpt">Berlin Brandenburg Airport suspended all flight operations Thursday night and Friday morning due to persistent freezing rain and black ice on runways. While takeoffs resumed by midday Friday, officials reported that de-icing procedures were taking up to an hour. That is twice the usual time required. (<a href="https://www.dw.com/en/berlin-brandenburg-airport-cancels-flights-second-day-black-ice-rain/a-75832931">DW.com</a>)</p>
<p>By late Friday afternoon, airlines had cancelled approximately half of the 500 scheduled starts and landings, leaving hundreds of passengers stranded overnight without clear information. Airport spokespeople attributed the chaos to extensive safety clearances needed for runways and rescue vehicles, citing safety as the top priority. (<a href="https://www.rbb24.de/panorama/beitrag/2026/02/flughafen-ber-eisregen-ausfaelle-verspaetungen-kritik.html">rbb24</a>)</p>
<p>Travelers faced continued disruptions this weekend as the domino effect of cancelled flights impacts schedules. The German Weather Service warns of further black ice risks. Officials urged passengers to check flight status online before traveling, noting that normal operations will recover slowly due to the severe weather.

<h2 id="🇩🇪-afd-youth-group-launches-in-berlin-and-brandenburg">🇩🇪 AfD Youth Group Launches in Berlin and Brandenburg</h2>
<p class="excerpt">The AfD&#39;s new youth organization, Generation Deutschland (GD), officially launched state chapters in Berlin and Brandenburg on Saturday. Members elected state parliamentarian Fabian Jank in Brandenburg and politician Martin Kohler in Berlin to lead the respective branches while hundreds of demonstrators protested outside both venues. (<a href="https://www.rbb24.de/politik/beitrag/2026/02/berlin-brandenburg--afd-jugendorganisation-gruendet-verbaende.html">rbb24</a>)</p>
<p>This group replaces the Junge Alternative, which disbanded in early 2025 after intelligence officials classified it as a confirmed right-wing extremist entity. Generation Deutschland is the official youth wing of the AfD, established in 2025 to replace the Junge Alternative. Its purpose is to recruit young people (aged 14 to 35) and train future party leaders. Integrated directly into the party structure, it promotes nationalist ideologies and requires members to join the AfD. (<a href="https://www.tagesschau.de/inland/gesellschaft/generation-deutschland-rechtsextremismus-100.html">Tagesschau</a>)</p>
<p>Officials stated that despite the rebranding, the new organization shows no signs of moderation compared to its predecessor. Authorities anticipate the group will likely receive the same extremist classification because many leadership figures maintain direct ties to the Identitarian Movement and former radical chapters. (<a href="https://www.welt.de/politik/deutschland/article69873d2b7e12c19d015ed198/generation-deutschland-wir-sind-preussen-neue-afd-jugendorganisation-in-berlin-und-brandenburg-gegruendet.html">WELT</a>)</p>

<h2 id="📢-thousands-rally-against-iranian-regime">📢 Thousands Rally Against Iranian Regime</h2>
<p class="excerpt">Police estimated 10,000 attendees gathered at Berlin&#39;s Brandenburg Gate on Saturday to protest Iran&#39;s clerical regime. Organized by the National Council of Resistance of Iran, the &quot;Free Iran&quot; rally featured addresses from opposition leader Maryam Rajavi and former US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. Participants marched to Potsdamer Platz, explicitly rejecting both the current theocracy and any return to the pre-1979 monarchy. (<a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/thousands-protest-berlin-solidarity-with-iranian-uprisings-2026-02-07/">Reuters</a>)</p>
<p>This mobilization coincides with the 1979 revolution&#39;s anniversary and follows nationwide uprisings sparked in December by severe economic hardship. These demonstrations rapidly evolved into political demands for regime change, leading to a violent state crackdown where human rights groups report over 3,400 deaths. The Berlin event garnered support from more than 340 international organizations and political figures, including former German ministers. (<a href="https://www.rbb24.de/politik/beitrag/2026/02/berlin-demonstration-iran-mullah-regime.html">rbb24</a>)</p>
<p>Speakers emphasized a democratic alternative for Iran&#39;s future, dismissing the exiled Shah’s son as an opportunist while calling for a secular republic. Former European Council President Charles Michel declared that Europe has learned its lesson regarding appeasement, asserting that silence equates to complicity. Rajavi urged the UN Security Council to intervene immediately to halt executions and hold the regime leadership accountable.

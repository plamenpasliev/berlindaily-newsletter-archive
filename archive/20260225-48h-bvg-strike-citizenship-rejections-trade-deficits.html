<h2 id="🚊-nationwide-public-transport-strike-on-friday-and-saturday">🚊 Nationwide Public Transport Strike on Friday and Saturday</h2>
<p class="excerpt">The Verdi trade union announced a nationwide 48-hour warning strike affecting local public transport in most German federal states, including Berlin&#39;s BVG. From 3 a.m. Friday, February 27, until Sunday morning, subways, trams, and buses will stop running, though Deutsche Bahn&#39;s S-Bahn and regional trains remain operational. (<a href="https://www.rbb24.de/wirtschaft/beitrag/2026/02/berlin-bvg-warnstreik-verdi-freitag-samstag.html">rbb24</a>)</p>
<p>Negotiations are currently focused on improved working conditions rather than wages, which were settled with a 20% raise last year. Union demands include a 35-hour work week, 33 days of vacation, and minimum 11-hour rest periods between shifts to alleviate heavy workloads for approximately 16,000 BVG employees. (<a href="https://www.berliner-kurier.de/berlin/48-stunden-streik-bvg-legt-berlin-komplett-lahm-li.10020733">Berliner Kurier</a>)</p>
<p>BVG management labeled the walkout a &quot;disproportionate escalation,&quot; claiming the package would cost €150 million annually plus huge infrastructure investments. This second wave of strikes follows a nationwide standstill on February 2, signaling a hardening conflict that could disrupt millions of commuters if the March negotiation rounds fail. (<a href="https://www.tagesspiegel.de/berlin/bundesweite-warnstreiks-im-nahverkehr-bvg-beschaftigte-in-berlin-legen-am-freitag-und-samstag-arbeit-nieder-15285864.html">Tagesspiegel</a>)</p>

<h2 id="🪪-berlin-rejects-one-in-20-citizenship-applications">🪪 Berlin Rejects One in 20 Citizenship Applications</h2>
<p class="excerpt">Berlin’s centralized immigration authority (LEA) rejected 4.9% of citizenship applications in 2025 (one in every 20 cases). While the fully digital approach successfully cleared a massive backlog and naturalized a record 39,034 people, the automated system has introduced higher security standards. Rejections were primarily driven by inconsistencies, missing data, and suspected document forgery flagged by the new digital checks. (<a href="https://www.thelocal.de/20260224/how-many-of-berlins-nearly-40000-naturalisations-last-year-were-rejected">The Local Germany</a>)</p>
<p>The crackdown follows a major 2025 investigation that uncovered a nationwide fraud ring selling fake B1 language and integration certificates for €1,500 on TikTok and Telegram. Police raids revealed that paid proxies were taking exams for applicants, prompting the CDU to demand a halt to naturalizations in cases of doubt. The LEA’s strict vetting is a direct response to this industrialized cheating, which previous paper-based systems failed to catch. (<a href="https://www.iamexpat.de/expat-info/germany-news/fraudsters-selling-fake-german-integration-certificates-online-investigation-finds">IamExpat</a>)</p>
<p>Berlin has shifted from simply clearing a backlog to aggressively hunting down fraud. This distinction is critical because a rejection for deception now triggers a mandatory 10-year ban on reapplying under the strict &quot;integrity&quot; laws passed in late 2025.

<h2 id="🇩🇪-merz-heads-to-china-amid-rising-trade-deficits">🇩🇪 Merz Heads to China Amid Rising Trade Deficits</h2>
<p class="excerpt">German Chancellor Friedrich Merz represents a delegation of corporate executives heading to Beijing on Wednesday for his first official visit. Amid rising economic tensions, Merz aims to address unfair competition and market access with President Xi Jinping. This diplomatic push comes as Europe’s largest economy faces a projected trade deficit with China approaching €90 billion in 2025. (<a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/german-chancellor-merz-heads-china-seeking-openings-global-pressure-builds-2026-02-24/">Reuters</a>)</p>
<p>German automakers are losing ground in their most vital market due to the rapid ascent of subsidized domestic rivals like BYD. While BYD received approximately $4.3 billion in state support between 2015 and 2020, German luxury brands are struggling. Recent data indicates Mercedes-Benz sales in China plummeted 19.2% over the last year, with BMW recording a similar 14.2% decline. (<a href="https://dominotheory.com/how-byds-meteoric-rise-has-reshaped-germany-china-relations/">dominotheory</a>)</p>
<p>This trip highlights Berlin&#39;s difficult balancing act between maintaining economic ties and reducing dependency on critical supply chains. Experts warn that Germany’s outbound trade has entered a structural decline, exacerbated by Beijing’s chokehold on resources. China currently controls 90% of global refining capacity for rare earth minerals, which are essential for manufacturing electric vehicles and advanced defense technologies.

<h2 id="🩺-dont-just-get-faster-care-get-better-care">🩺 Don’t Just Get Faster Care. Get Better Care.</h2>
<p>Many people in Berlin assume private health insurance is only about shorter wait times. But the real advantage is better care when it matters most: access to top specialists, broader treatment options, and more comfort in the hospital. Often with the same doctors public patients wait months to see.</p>
<p>For internationals, the process can feel overwhelming. Eligibility rules, plan comparisons, and German paperwork make it easy to delay the decision or choose a policy that doesn’t actually fit your needs.</p>
<p><strong>Feather</strong> makes switching simple. Their entire process, from signup to claims, happens online and in English, with expert support at every step. That means no broker back-and-forth, no confusing paperwork, and no guessing whether you’re making the right choice.</p>
<p>If you earn over €77,400/year (employed) or €36,000/year (self-employed), you may be eligible to switch and get access to significantly better coverage. 👉 <a href="https://feather-insurance.com/health-insurance/private?&amp;utm_source=berlindaily&amp;utm_medium=newsletter&amp;utm_campaign=private-2#calculator">Get private health insurance with Feather.</a></p>

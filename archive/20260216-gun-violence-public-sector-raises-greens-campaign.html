<h2 id="🔫-gun-violence-spikes">🔫 Gun Violence Spikes</h2>
<p class="excerpt">A 37-year-old man was critically injured on Thursday evening after an unknown assailant fired multiple shots into his vehicle from the sidewalk in Berlin-Tegel. Hours later, police discovered bullet holes in the windows of an apartment building in Kreuzberg, though no injuries occurred in this second overnight incident. (<a href="https://www.tagesspiegel.de/berlin/ein-verletzter-in-berlin-schusse-auf-fahrzeug-in-tegel-und-geschaft-in-kreuzberg-abgefeuert-15246827.html">Tagesspiegel</a>)</p>
<p>These attacks mark the latest in a series of violent events across the capital, following gunfire directed at a Köpenick apartment door on Wednesday and a Wedding hookah bar on Sunday. Authorities recently established the &quot;Ferrum&quot; special police unit to specifically target rising gang-related gun violence and organized crime. (<a href="https://www.rbb24.de/panorama/beitrag/2026/02/berlin-schuesse-auto-tegel-mensch-schwer-verletzt-kreuzberg.html">rbb24</a>)</p>
<p>Berlin Justice Senator Felor Badenberg has warned of a new threat level driven by rival groups openly using grenades and firearms in public spaces. In response, the specialized task force has seized 12 live weapons and 192 cartridges while executing nine arrest warrants over the past three months. (<a href="https://www.welt.de/vermischtes/article698f08a5616e1cbb1fcd509d/berlin-mann-durch-schuesse-lebensgefaehrlich-verletzt-vermehrt-vorfaelle-in-der-hauptstadt.html">WELT</a>)</p>

<h2 id="🤝-german-states-agree-to-58-public-sector-raise">🤝 German States Agree to 5.8% Public Sector Raise</h2>
<p class="excerpt">Unions and German state employers reached an agreement granting roughly 2.5 million public sector workers a 5.8% wage increase. The deal, which averts indefinite strikes, applies to 900,000 employees and will extend to 1.3 million civil servants. Valid for 27 months until January 2028, the contract guarantees a minimum monthly pay rise of €100, while trainees will receive an additional €150. (<a href="https://www.rbb24.de/wirtschaft/beitrag/2026/02/tarifkonflikt-oeffentlicher-dienst-verdi-beamtenbund-dbb-potsdam.html">rbb24</a>)</p>
<p>The pay raise occurs in three stages: 2.8% in April 2026, 2.0% in March 2027, and 1.0% in January 2028. While unions originally demanded 7% over 12 months, this deal notably aligns East German working conditions with the West, including dismissal protections. State officials estimate the total cost for employees and civil servants will reach approximately €12.34 billion, presenting a significant burden for regional budgets. (<a href="https://www.tagesspiegel.de/berlin/evers-zur-tarifeinigung-fur-lander-beschaftigte-berlins-finanzsenator-spricht-von-einem-schmerzhaften-kompromiss-15250901.html">Tagesspiegel</a>)</p>
<p>This agreement secures planning certainty for critical services like police and schools, though officials describe it as testing financial limits. Berlin Finance Senator Stefan Evers termed the deal a &quot;painful but justifiable compromise&quot; necessary to remain a competitive employer. While the pact costs Brandenburg over €300 million through next year, police unions criticized the long duration, arguing it leaves workers trailing federal standards.

<h2 id="🗳️-greens-launch-campaign-to-unseat-mayor-wegner">🗳️ Greens Launch Campaign to Unseat Mayor Wegner</h2>
<p class="excerpt">The Berlin Greens officially launched their election campaign at a party conference in Neukölln, presenting a united front against Mayor Kai Wegner. Top candidate Werner Graf attacked the current CDU-led coalition for its alleged lack of planning, declaring it is time for Wegner to &quot;move out&quot; of the Red City Hall by the September 20 vote. (<a href="https://www.morgenpost.de/berlin/article411205441/eigenbedarf-im-roten-rathaus-gruene-gehen-geeint-in-wahlkampf.html">Berliner Morgenpost</a>)</p>
<p>The party is currently polling between 14% and 16%, trailing behind the CDU and Die Linke. To regain ground, their platform includes a ban on private jets at BER airport and a commitment to implement the 2021 referendum to expropriate large housing corporations. Additionally, they propose a €9 nationwide transit ticket for low-income residents. (<a href="https://www.n-tv.de/regionales/berlin-und-brandenburg/Gruene-wollen-Planlosigkeit-im-Roten-Rathaus-beenden-id30362421.html">Ntv</a>)</p>
<p>This election could reshape the capital&#39;s housing market, as the Greens introduced an &quot;Affordable Rent Law&quot; to penalize landlords who violate price caps. Graf warned that failing to solve the rental crisis will damage democracy itself. Delegates also voted to abolish the state’s Neutrality Law, which prohibited public sector employees in some areas from wearing visible religious symbols or clothing while on duty.

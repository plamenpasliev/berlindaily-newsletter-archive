<h2 id="🎆-new-years-eve-preparations">🎆 New Year&#39;s Eve Preparations</h2>
<p class="excerpt">Berlin will deploy 4,300 police officers this New Year’s Eve, a massive increase from the usual 1,000, to prevent riots and targeted attacks on emergency services. Authorities have expanded firework prohibition zones to include the Admiralbrücke, alongside existing bans in Steinmetzkiez and Sonnenallee. Police will also use preventive custody for up to five days against aggressors. (<a href="https://www.tagesspiegel.de/berlin/polizei-justiz/furcht-vor-boller-exzessen-ohne-rucksicht-auf-verluste-berlin-setzt-in-der-silvesternacht-4300-polizisten-ein-15088774.html">Tagesspiegel</a>)</p>
<p>Public transport will facilitate safe travel with S-Bahn and U-Bahn lines running throughout the night at short intervals. Brandenburger Tor will host the &quot;Yeah 26&quot; party for 20,000 registered guests while underground trains will bypass the station from late afternoon. Officials also advise owners to keep pets indoors to protect them from the noise. (<a href="https://www.berlin.de/en/news/10106842-5559700-new-years-eve-timetables-restricted-area.en.html">berlin.de</a>)</p>
<p>These precautions respond to escalating violence during previous celebrations, where emergency responders were deliberately targeted. Last year, 44 officers were injured in Berlin alone, including one who was nearly killed by a firework. Officials hope the increased police presence and new legal tools will deter offenders and protect the 1,600 rescue workers deployed.

<h2 id="❤️-cold-bus-arson-attack">❤️ &#39;Cold Bus&#39; Arson Attack</h2>
<p class="excerpt">Berlin police are investigating a suspected arson attack that destroyed one “Kältebus” (cold bus) and damaged another belonging to the Berliner Stadtmission on Sunday night. A witness alerted the fire department around 3:15 a.m. after seeing an unknown person near the vehicles on Seydlitzstraße in Moabit. The incident leaves the organization with only one operational bus during freezing temperatures. (<a href="https://www.faz.net/aktuell/gesellschaft/menschen/berlin-zwei-kaeltebusse-fuer-obdachlose-nach-brand-ausser-betrieb-accg-200392570.html">FAZ</a>)</p>
<p>The attack triggered an immediate wave of solidarity to keep the vital service running without interruption. A private ambulance company and the social carrier Gebewo stepped in to lend vehicles, while an auto rental agency offered temporary replacements. Stadtmission spokesperson Barbara Breuer described the team as &quot;overwhelmed&quot; by the offers of help and donations from across the city. (<a href="https://www.tagesspiegel.de/berlin/berliner-stadtmission-erfahrt-unglaubliche-solidaritat-trager-und-privatperson-stellen-helfern-neue-kaltebusse-15085683.html">Tagesspiegel</a>)</p>
<p>These patrols serve as a critical lifeline when temperatures drop, with the Stadtmission fielding approximately 120 calls nightly. During the last winter season, the organization successfully transported 2,100 individuals to warm accommodations. Social Senator Cansel Kiziltepe condemned the destruction of the lifesaving vehicles as an attack that &quot;directly endangers lives.&quot; (<a href="https://www.n-tv.de/regionales/berlin-und-brandenburg/Kaeltebusse-brennen-aus-Hilfsbereitschaft-rettet-Angebot-id30186039.html">Ntv</a>)</p>

<h2 id="🎥-3000-bodycams-before-nye">🎥 3,000 Bodycams Before NYE</h2>
<p class="excerpt">Berlin distributed 3,000 body cameras to emergency personnel yesterday ahead of New Year&#39;s Eve celebrations. The €3 million rollout assigns 2,300 units to police officers and 700 to firefighters. Interior Senator Iris Spranger confirmed this delivery marks the final transition from trial operations into standard daily service. (<a href="https://www.rbb24.de/politik/beitrag/2025/12/berlin-jahreswechsel-polizei-feuerwehr-bodycams-iris-spranger-.html">rbb24</a>)</p>
<p>Strict privacy regulations govern when officers may activate the devices. Recording is not continuous but &quot;event-related,&quot; permitted only during dangerous situations, evidence collection, or to protect officers. A recent legal change now allows use inside private homes if there is an immediate threat to life or safety. (<a href="https://www.berliner-kurier.de/berlin/polizei-ueberwacht-berlin-jetzt-mit-bodycams-li.10011846">Berliner Kurier</a>)</p>
<p>Police President Barbara Slowik emphasizes that the footage will create objective documentation of critical incidents to increase transparency. Beyond evidence, the visible presence of cameras aims to deter aggression and de-escalate volatile encounters. Fire Chief Karsten Homrighausen noted the devices allow for &quot;court-proof&quot; records of assaults on his staff.

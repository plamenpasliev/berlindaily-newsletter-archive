<h2 id="🚲-nextbike-ordered-to-remove-6500-bikes-from-berlin">🚲 Nextbike Ordered to Remove 6,500 Bikes From Berlin</h2>
<p class="excerpt">Berlin’s Higher Administrative Court ruled that Nextbike must immediately remove its 6,500 rental bikes from city streets. The decision follows a legal dispute after the company failed to obtain a required special use permit. Nextbike continued operating privately after its public contract expired last summer, a move the court declared unauthorized (<a href="https://www.the-berliner.com/english-news-berlin/nextbike-must-remove-6500-bikes-from-berlins-streets/">The Berliner</a>)</p>
<p>This conflict began in June 2025 when Berlin ended its subsidized agreement with Nextbike due to budget cuts. The company transitioned to a private business model but neglected to apply for mandatory commercial road-use permits, leading the Senate to order the fleet&#39;s immediate removal to clear public space (<a href="https://www.rbb24.de/wirtschaft/beitrag/2026/01/berlin-nextbike-leihraeder-olg-entscheidung-sondernutzungserlaubnis.html">rbb24</a>)</p>
<p>Nextbike announced it will comply with the ruling by formally requesting the permits while reducing its fleet to 5,500 bikes. The provider aims to maintain service without interruption, arguing that cycling offers higher social value than other micro-mobility options and remains essential for Berlin’s climate goals (<a href="https://www.tagesspiegel.de/berlin/trotz-juristischer-niederlage-leihradanbieter-nextbike-will-betrieb-in-berlin-fortsetzen-15169428.html">Tagesspiegel</a>)</p>

<h2 id="🕵️♀️-suspected-russian-spy-arrested-in-berlin">🕵️‍♀️ Suspected Russian Spy Arrested in Berlin</h2>
<p class="excerpt">German authorities arrested a dual German-Ukrainian national, Ilona W., in Berlin for allegedly spying for Russia’s military intelligence service. Since late 2023, she reportedly gathered sensitive data on drone testing, arms manufacturing locations, and military deliveries destined for Ukraine. Prosecutors claim she used her political network to provide Russian officials with access to high-level events under false identities. (<a href="https://www.dw.com/en/germany-news-woman-arrested-in-berlin-over-russian-spy-case/live-75587808">DW</a>)</p>
<p>Investigators also targeted two former Bundeswehr officials, including a recently retired staff officer and a former technical director. The men are suspected of disclosing official information about military equipment and aircraft to the intermediary. While the suspects remain free, police searched properties across three states to determine if they knowingly assisted a foreign intelligence operation. (<a href="https://www.tagesspiegel.de/politik/sie-soll-informationen-uber-ukrainekrieg-weitergegeben-haben-mutmassliche-spionin-russlands-in-berlin-festgenommen-15163751.html">Tagesspiegel</a>)</p>
<p>In response, Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul expelled a Russian diplomat identified as the woman’s handler. The government summoned the Russian ambassador to formally declare the official unwelcome and condemn the espionage as a hostile act. Officials emphasized that Germany will not tolerate intelligence activities being conducted under the protection of a diplomatic mission.

<h2 id="🚗-reported-1700-job-cuts-at-tesla">🚗 Reported 1,700 Job Cuts at Tesla</h2>
<p class="excerpt">Reports indicate Tesla’s workforce at its Gruenheide gigafactory has shrunk by roughly 1,700 employees, a 14% decline since 2024. Business daily Handelsblatt cited internal documents for upcoming works council elections, which show the current headcount at 10,703 workers. This sharp drop contradicts previous suggestions that the European site’s staffing remained stable. (<a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/tesla-reduces-berlin-staff-by-1700-handelsblatt-reports-2026-01-21/">Reuters</a>)</p>
<p>Tesla has officially denied the report, stating it has no plans to curb production or reduce staff. The company maintains that the number of permanent employees has not significantly changed since 2024. Management attributed the decrease to &quot;completely normal&quot; personnel fluctuations and a reduced need for temporary workers following the initial factory ramp-up. (<a href="https://money.usnews.com/investing/news/articles/2026-01-21/tesla-reduces-berlin-staff-by-1-700-handelsblatt-reports">US News</a>)</p>
<p>Industry analysts suggest the discrepancy points to a &quot;quiet downsizing&quot; caused by stagnant European demand and overcapacity. While Tesla insists the plant&#39;s outlook is stable, critics argue the company may be letting temporary contracts expire to avoid formal layoff notifications. The site currently faces pressure from increased competition and potential labor union disputes.

<h2 id="💼-probably-fine-works--until-it-doesnt">💼 “Probably Fine” Works — Until it Doesn’t.</h2>
<p>Germany doesn’t make independent work impossible. It makes it precise. That’s where many people get stuck — not because they’re careless, but because the rules are rarely clear upfront. </p>
<p>Factofly exists to change that. They are building a structured, compliant way to work project-based in Germany. Each project runs under a clear employed setup, while contracts, payroll, taxes, and social contributions are handled centrally. Right now, they are expanding from Denmark and intentionally keeping things small. </p>
<p>The waitlist isn’t about urgency — it’s about learning. Early access, personal onboarding, and a real chance to shape how this works before anything scales. If “probably fine” doesn’t feel good enough anymore, this is worth a look. 👉 <a href="https://factofly.de/en/waitlist/?utm_source=berlin_daily&amp;utm_medium=newsletter&amp;utm_campaign=de_launch_waitlist&amp;utm_content=slot_2"><strong>Learn more and join the waitlist.</strong></a></p>

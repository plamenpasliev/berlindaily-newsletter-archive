<h2 id="✈️-germany-resumes-criminal-deportations-to-syria">✈️ Germany Resumes Criminal Deportations to Syria</h2>
<p class="excerpt">Germany deported a Syrian criminal to Damascus Tuesday, marking the first such removal since the civil war began in 2011. The 37-year-old man, convicted of robbery and extortion in North Rhine-Westphalia, was handed over to Syrian authorities. This action follows a new agreement enabling regular returns of offenders. (<a href="https://www.dw.com/en/germany-resumes-deportations-to-syria-for-first-time-since-2011/a-75287833">DW</a>)</p>
<p>Interior Minister Alexander Dobrindt defended the move, stating society has a legitimate interest in expelling criminals. This shift aligns with the governing coalition&#39;s pledge to limit migration and resume returns to Syria and Afghanistan. Authorities also deported a convicted Afghan offender to Kabul earlier on the same day. (<a href="https://www.infomigrants.net/en/post/68906/germany-deportations-to-syria-resume-after-15-years-with-criminal-asylum-seeker-sent-back">InfoMigrants</a>)</p>
<p>The policy change follows the fall of Bashar al-Assad&#39;s regime over a year ago. Chancellor Friedrich Merz argues the civil war has effectively ended, removing grounds for general asylum. However, Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul warned that infrastructure remains destroyed, making large-scale returns of non-criminals currently unrealistic. (<a href="https://www.zdfheute.de/politik/deutschland/syrien-abschiebung-buergerkrieg-afghanistan-100.html">ZDFheute</a>)</p>
<p>This resumption challenges the principle of <em>non-refoulement</em>, a cornerstone of international law. The doctrine prohibits states from returning individuals to territories where they face a credible risk of persecution, torture, or irreparable harm. Exceptions are historically rare, usually requiring proof that the individual poses a severe security danger. (<a href="https://www.ohchr.org/en/instruments-mechanisms/instruments/convention-relating-status-refugees">OHCHR</a>)</p>
<p>This marks a major pivot for Germany, home to roughly 1 million Syrians. Public sentiment increasingly supports the crackdown, with 53 percent of polled Germans backing reduced asylum numbers. The move suggests a tougher future stance for the EU&#39;s largest economy regarding refugee protection standards.

<h2 id="🧣-berlin-faces-coldest-christmas-in-15-years">🧣 Berlin Faces Coldest Christmas in 15 Years</h2>
<p class="excerpt">Berlin and Brandenburg will experience freezing temperatures throughout the holidays. The German Weather Service (DWD) forecasts clear skies and highs around -1°C on Christmas Eve, with temperatures dropping to between -5°C and -9°C overnight. The first day of Christmas will remain sunny but sub-zero, while nights could plummet to -10°C before clouds return on Friday. (<a href="https://www.berliner-zeitung.de/news/wetter-in-berlin-aktuell-das-ist-die-prognose-fuer-weihnachten-li.10011580">Berliner Zeitung</a>)</p>
<p>This year&#39;s dry freeze aligns with long-term climate data showing dwindling chances for snow. While many locals hope for a &quot;White Christmas,&quot; DWD statistics reveal that for Berlin-Dahlem, the probability of snow on all three holidays dropped from 16.7% between 1961 and 1990 to just 6.7% in the period from 1991 to 2020. (<a href="https://www.spiegel.de/wissenschaft/natur/weisse-weihnachten-wie-oft-gab-es-frueher-in-deutschland-schnee-an-heiligabend-a-69486411-9252-4752-b131-008101452292">Der Spiegel</a>)</p>
<p>The severe drop in temperature poses acute risks for the city&#39;s homeless population. In December 2024, the &quot;Berliner Kältehilfe&quot; system provided 1,162 emergency sleeping places, with utilization rates in districts like Mitte reaching over 100%. &quot;Kältebus&quot; and &quot;Wärmebus&quot; patrols are currently operating nightly to transport vulnerable people to these shelters to prevent hypothermia. (<a href="https://www.kaeltehilfe-berlin.de">Kältehilfe Berlin</a>)</p>
<p>The DWD has issued a &quot;Level 1&quot; frost warning for the region. This yellow-coded &quot;Weather Warning&quot; indicates that while the weather conditions—in this case, widespread sub-zero temperatures—are not unusual, they can still be hazardous. The agency advises citizens to exercise caution during outdoor activities and be aware of potential impacts on infrastructure. (<a href="https://www.wettergefahren.de">Wettergefahren.de</a>)</p>
<p>This cold snap is statistically significant, potentially marking the coldest Christmas since 2010. Meteorologist Nico Bauer notes that the 2010 holidays averaged -5.2°C, a sharp contrast to recent mild winters. With a projected three-day average of -2°C to -3°C this year, the region is experiencing a rare deviation from the warming trend.

<h2 id="🚑-berlin--brandenburg-holiday-emergency-contacts">🚑 Berlin &amp; Brandenburg Holiday Emergency Contacts</h2>
<p class="excerpt">Berlin and Brandenburg residents have access to specific emergency services during the holidays. The nationwide number 116 117 operates 24/7 for general medical needs, while specific Berlin clinics like Charité Campus Benjamin Franklin and Vivantes Neukölln remain open from 9 am to 9 pm. Parents can contact the poison emergency hotline at 030 19240, and the Kinder-Notdienst provides crisis support for children. (<a href="https://www.rbb24.de/panorama/beitrag/2025/12/berlin-brandenburg-weihnachten-feiertage-notfaelle-polizei-aerzte.html">rbb24</a>)</p>
<p>Psychosocial and social services remain fully operational to support vulnerable groups. The Berliner Krisendienst offers round-the-clock assistance for psychiatric emergencies, while the BIG Hotline supports women facing domestic violence. For homeless individuals, the Berlin Cold Bus (&quot;Kältebus&quot;) runs daily from November to March, operating from 8 pm to 2 am to transport people to heated shelters. (<a href="https://www.rbb24.de/panorama/beitrag/2025/12/berlin-brandenburg-weihnachten-feiertage-notfaelle-polizei-aerzte.html">rbb24</a>)</p>
<p>Infrastructure and utility providers maintain hotlines for technical emergencies involving water, gas, or electricity. Berliners can report power outages to Stromnetz Berlin, while pharmacy locations are accessible via the mobile short code 22 8 33 for urgent medication needs. Most retail stores close on New Year&#39;s Day, though supermarkets at major train stations and Berlin Brandenburg Airport (BER) remain open. (<a href="https://www.rbb24.de/panorama/beitrag/2025/12/berlin-brandenburg-weihnachten-feiertage-notfaelle-polizei-aerzte.html">rbb24</a>)</p>
<p>The 116 117 hotline serves as the central &quot;Patient Service Number&quot; throughout Germany. Operated by the National Association of Statutory Health Insurance Physicians, it directs patients to on-call practices for non-life-threatening ailments when regular surgeries are closed. This system ensures medical care is available nights and weekends without overcrowding emergency rooms reserved for critical 112 calls. (<a href="https://www.116117.de">116117.de</a>)</p>
<p>Access to these official channels prevents unnecessary costs and ensures safety during the widespread holiday closures. Calling a private emergency electrician can cost at least €230, whereas utility providers handle grid-level issues directly. With general practitioners and most shops closed, these designated networks bridge the gap in essential public services.

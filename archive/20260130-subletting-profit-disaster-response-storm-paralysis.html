<h2 id="💰-tenants-can-no-longer-profit-from-subletting">💰 Tenants Can no Longer Profit from Subletting</h2>
<p>Germany&#39;s high court ruled on Wednesday that tenants are forbidden from making a profit through subletting. The court clarified that while subletting is a legitimate way to cover rent while away, it cannot be turned into a business model. Any income exceeding actual housing expenses is now considered a violation of the primary rental agreement. (<a href="https://www.rbb24.de/panorama/beitrag/2026/01/mieter-untermiete-bundesgerichtshof-urteil-kein-gewinn-berlin.html">rbb24</a>)</p>
<p>The ruling stemmed from a Berlin case where a tenant charged €962 for a flat with a base rent of €460. Though the tenant claimed the surcharge was for extensive furnishings like a dishwasher and sound system, the court upheld the landlord&#39;s eviction notice. This sets a precedent against using subletting to exploit tight urban housing markets. (<a href="https://www.the-berliner.com/english-news-berlin/german-court-rules-against-profit-from-subletting/">The Berliner</a>)</p>
<p>To close legal loopholes, the Federal Ministry of Justice is drafting legislation to regulate furnishing surcharges. Proposed rules include a 5% cap on net rent for fully furnished units to prevent &quot;shadow rental markets.&quot; Housing advocates praised the court&#39;s decision as a victory for fairness, ensuring housing remains a basic need rather than a profit vehicle.

<h2 id="🔦-berlin-unifies-disaster-response-after-blackout">🔦 Berlin Unifies Disaster Response After Blackout</h2>
<p class="excerpt">Berlin officials agreed to standardize disaster protection across all districts following a recent major power outage. The Senate will fund new technical equipment like satellite phones and increase dedicated staff from two to five per district. Authorities also introduced &quot;KatHelfer&quot;, a digital system to coordinate volunteers. (<a href="https://www.rbb24.de/politik/beitrag/2026/01/berlin-einheitlicher-katastrophenschutz-alle-bezirke.html">rbb24</a>)</p>
<p>The new response strategy utilizes a digital project &quot;KatHelfer&quot; to organize spontaneous volunteers through common messaging apps. Chatbots will categorize residents by specific skills, such as manual labor or caregiving abilities, to create a virtual bulletin board. This aims to fix communication failures observed during the recent blackout. (<a href="https://www.tagesspiegel.de/berlin/starke-arme-organisationstalent-grosses-herz-so-will-berlin-freiwillige-helfer-im-krisenfall-besser-einsetzen-15193006.html">tagesspiegel.de</a>)</p>
<p>Interior Senator Iris Spranger seeks legal reforms to grant the state government direct authority over district-level disaster management. Proposed changes include loosening data privacy rules to create a registry of vulnerable residents requiring help. Officials also plan to restrict public access to sensitive infrastructure maps to prevent sabotage. (<a href="https://taz.de/Nach-Stromausfall-in-Berlin/!6149650/">taz.de</a>)</p>

<h2 id="❄️-trams-recover-after-ice-storm-paralysis">❄️ Trams Recover After Ice Storm Paralysis</h2>
<p class="excerpt">Berlin&#39;s tram network is gradually recovering after severe freezing rain coated overhead lines in thick ice, initially paralyzing the entire system. While bus and subway services have largely returned to normal schedules, roughly 75% of the tram lines are now operational following days of total suspension. Crews continue working continuously to manually de-ice the remaining affected routes. (<a href="https://www.tagesspiegel.de/berlin/eis-chaos-in-berlin-u-bahn-und-bus-fahren-wieder-planmassig--diese-tram-linien-sind-noch-betroffen-15185307.html">Tagesspiegel</a>)</p>
<p>The chaos resulted from a specific weather event where up to eight liters of freezing rain per square meter struck the capital. Unlike neighboring Potsdam, which kept trams running by applying anti-icing fluids to overhead wires, Berlin&#39;s massive 200-kilometer network lacked these preventive measures. The public transport authority admitted they had not previously required chemical de-icing agents for winter operations. (<a href="https://www.rbb24.de/panorama/beitrag/2026/01/strassenbahnen-tram-berlin-eisregen-bvg-ausfaelle.html">rbb24</a>)</p>
<p>Officials are demanding structural changes, criticizing the current reliance on manual de-icing as insufficient for a major metropolitan infrastructure. Senator Ute Bonde urged the transport authority to adopt preventive strategies used in other cities, such as treating power lines with glycerin to prevent ice buildup. Future plans may include testing automated de-icing systems in specialized climate chambers to improve resilience.

<p>Most people working independently in Germany don’t break the rules on purpose. They just never get a clear answer on whether their setup is actually solid. Until it matters. Factofly exists to change that.</p>
<p>We’re testing a cleaner way to work project-based in Germany — with clarity instead of assumptions. Each project runs under a clear employed structure, while the legal and administrative complexity stays in the background.</p>
<p>As we expand from Denmark to Germany, we’re starting deliberately small. The waitlist is how we’re gauging demand, offering early access, and doing personal 1:1 onboarding before anything scales. No hype. No pressure.

<h2 id="🔒-berlins-görlitzer-park-to-close-nightly">🔒 Berlin&#39;s Görlitzer Park to Close Nightly</h2>
<p class="excerpt">Starting March 1, Berlin’s Görlitzer Park will close nightly to combat crime. If you go through Görli at night, expect detours around the fenced entrances. The Senate administration confirmed that private security firms will lock the newly installed gates between 10 p.m. and 6 a.m. during winter months, shifting to an 11 p.m. start time in summer.  (<a href="https://www.rbb24.de/panorama/beitrag/2026/02/berlin-goerlitzer-park-goerli-zaun-kriminalitaet-nachts-senat-bezirk-zaunfrei.html">rbb24</a>)</p>
<p>The controversial project includes approximately 300 meters of additional fencing, 16 steel gates, and eight heavy-duty turnstiles designed to secure the area. While the physical construction costs remain around €2 million, the city has allocated an additional €800,000 annually specifically for the private personnel required to manage access and patrol the grounds. (<a href="https://www.berliner-kurier.de/berlin/goerlitzer-park-ab-maerz-fuer-800000-euro-nacht-fuer-nacht-geschlossen-li.10020023">Berliner Kurier</a>)</p>
<p>Authorities argue this measure is necessary to dismantle the park&#39;s status as a retreat for drug dealers, though the district administration criticizes the plan as costly and purely symbolic. Local initiatives have threatened civil disobedience, and a lawsuit filed by the Friedrichshain-Kreuzberg district against the Senate remains pending at the Berlin Administrative Court.

<h2 id="🚫-50-escalators-shut-down-at-hauptbahnhof-and-südkreuz">🚫 50+ Escalators Shut Down at Hauptbahnhof and Südkreuz</h2>
<p class="excerpt">Deutsche Bahn has abruptly shut down more than 50 escalators across two major Berlin train stations following safety concerns. Officials took 42 units offline at Hauptbahnhof and 10 at Südkreuz after discovering potential transmission defects in a specific equipment model. The operator confirmed two escalators had previously stopped unexpectedly during operation. (<a href="https://www.rbb24.de/wirtschaft/beitrag/2026/02/berlin-bahn-probleme-rolltreppen-hauptbahnhof-suedkreuz.html">rbb24</a>)</p>
<p>Engineers are currently inspecting the machinery, though a timeline for restoring service remains unclear until a status update planned for Friday. While elevators remain functional, the closures significantly disrupt flows at Hauptbahnhof, which spans four vertical levels and serves approximately 330,000 daily passengers. Additional staff members have been deployed to assist travelers. (<a href="https://www.moz.de/nachrichten/brandenburg/bahn-in-berlin-rolltreppen-am-hauptbahnhof-und-suedkreuz-laenger-ausser-betrieb-78658923.html">MOZ.de</a>)</p>
<p>This mass outage highlights the vulnerability of critical infrastructure, as widespread defects in a single component type forced the preventive shutdown of nearly 80% of Hauptbahnhof&#39;s escalators. Reports indicate the malfunction might have caused steps to reverse direction, prompting immediate safety checks to prevent dangerous accidents in these high-traffic transit hubs.

<h2 id="🇩🇪-one-in-five-germans-open-to-authoritarian-ideas">🇩🇪 One in Five Germans Open to Authoritarian Ideas</h2>
<p class="excerpt">The government-funded &quot;Deutschland-Monitor 2025&quot; reveals that 21% of Germans are open to authoritarian ideas, a figure rising to 26% in eastern states. Although 99% abstractly support democracy, researchers found significant approval for anti-democratic concepts like a single strong party representing the &quot;people&#39;s will.&quot; (<a href="https://www.zeit.de/politik/deutschland/2026-02/deutschland-monitor-demokratie-extremismus-populismus-veraenderung-gxe">DIE ZEIT</a>)</p>
<p>The study highlights a contradictory &quot;gray area&quot; where 31% of respondents favor a one-party system and 11% support a strong leader acting without parliamentary oversight. These anti-pluralist sentiments are most entrenched in structurally weak regions, particularly where residents report feeling economically &quot;left behind&quot; and undervalued. (<a href="https://www.faz.net/aktuell/politik/inland/studie-viele-deutsche-sind-offen-fuer-autoritaere-ideen-110840619.html">FAZ</a>)</p>
<p>Eastern Commissioner Elisabeth Kaiser warns that democratic coexistence is under pressure, explicitly linking populist attitudes to regional structural weaknesses. With satisfaction regarding the functioning of democracy at just 60% nationwide, experts fear this disconnect could support extremist parties in upcoming state elections in eastern Germany.

<h2 id="🇩🇪-labour-minister-examines-a-ban-on-subcontractors">🇩🇪 Labour minister examines a ban on subcontractors</h2>
<p class="excerpt">Germany’s labour minister Bärbel Bas plans to examine a ban on subcontractors for food delivery platforms. The move follows rbb findings of forced undeclared work, unpaid wages, threats, and violence among riders working for firms supplying Wolt and Uber Eats. Bas argues that only direct employment can ensure transparency and compliance with labour law. (<a href="https://www.tagesschau.de/investigativ/rbb/lieferdienste-subunternehmer-bas-100.html">tagesschau.de</a>)</p>
<p>A European Commission analysis estimated over 500 digital labour platforms in the EU employing about 28 million people in 2021, with that figure projected to reach 43 million by 2025. At least 5.5 million workers may be wrongly classified as self‑employed, losing access to key protections. (<a href="https://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/en/press-room/20240205IPR17417/provisional-deal-on-first-eu-wide-rules-for-platform-workers">European Parliament</a>)</p>
<p>New EU rules presume app-based workers (like Uber drivers) are employees, not freelancers, if platforms control their duties. This shift grants millions access to minimum wage and sick pay. Additionally, &quot;algorithmic management&quot; faces restrictions: apps must disclose how decisions are made, and humans (not AI) must oversee firings and suspensions. (<a href="https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2024/10/14/platform-workers-council-adopts-new-rules-to-improve-their-working-conditions/">Council of the EU</a>)</p>
<p>Bas’s proposal signals that Germany may go further than EU minimum rules by directly banning subcontracting in this sector. That would mirror the meat industry, where a 2021 subcontracting ban led to more than 23,000 additional direct employees, about an 18 % increase in one year, and fewer reported workplace accidents.

<p>🇩🇪 <a href="https://www.morgenpost.de/berlin/article410606378/untersuchung-offenbart-erschreckende-zahlen-zu-mieten-in-berlin.html"><em>Study reveals alarming figures on rents in Berlin</em></a> | Nearly half of Berlin’s existing rental listings are priced above Germany’s rent control limit, according to a new study by the German Tenants’ Association (DMB). More than two thirds of furnished offers violate the rules, and a third exceed the legal “rent usury” threshold. Violations in Ulm are even higher. The DMB urges stricter laws and heavy fines.</p>
<p>🇩🇪 <a href="https://www.tagesspiegel.de/berlin/bollerei-und-wahnsinn-in-berlin-ein-verbot-fur-privatfeuerwerk-behandelt-nur-die-symptome-14999813.html"><em>Fireworks and madness in Berlin: a ban on private fireworks only treats the symptoms</em></a> | The piece argues Berlin’s debate over private fireworks bans misses a deeper problem. Serious injuries, attacks on emergency workers, and illegal explosives reflect a breakdown in basic civic norms. Broad bans would be hard to enforce and would curb responsible families, too. The author calls instead for confronting the wider loss of civility behind the violence.</p>
<p>🇩🇪 <a href="https://www.berliner-kurier.de/berlin/hier-koennen-sie-sperrmuell-kostenlos-in-ihrem-kiez-loswerden-li.10008309"><em>Dumping bulky waste? You can now do this free of charge in your neighborhood</em></a> | Berlin’s public cleaning service BSR is setting up December “Kieztage,” where residents can drop bulky waste for free without visiting a recycling center. The program accepts items like furniture, mattresses, electronics, and textiles, and adds a small swap market for reusable goods. Hazardous items still require disposal at regular recycling yards.</p>
<p>🇩🇪 <a href="https://www.rbb24.de/panorama/beitrag/2025/12/grippesaison-subklade-k-influenza-covid-rsv-erkaeltung-.html"><em>Is it just a cold or is it the flu?</em></a> | Health officials say Germany’s flu wave is just starting, with about seven million people currently reporting acute respiratory illnesses. A new H3N2 subtype, “Subclade K,” is driving earlier and higher case numbers in Europe but does not appear more severe. Experts still recommend flu vaccination, especially for high‑risk groups, plus basic hygiene and timely testing.</p>

The force will grow from 40 to 130 specialists and is backed by €100M for counter-drone tech. Officials warn drone technology evolves in weeks, and complex split jurisdictions could still slow real-time responses.</p>

She retrained with a new club using step counting, touch, and sound cues to master complex routines. She now coaches children and adults with disabilities and recently received a Berlin sports inclusion honor.</p>
<p>🇩🇪 <a href="https://www.bz-berlin.de/berlin/mitte/tiergarten-130-meter-hochhaus"><em>130-meter high-rise to be built in Berlin-Tiergarten</em></a> | Developers want to build two residential towers with 284 flats (including 85 subsidized units) on Hasso Plattner’s Tiergarten property, but a protected 1950s pavilion and heritage rules still block progress. The project highlights Berlin’s new high-rise policy, which drops mandatory public roof terraces and office space quotas to speed dense housing construction.</p>

Most of this time goes to administration, not teaching quality or staff support. Yet 85% would choose the role again, raising concerns about burnout and future hiring.</p>

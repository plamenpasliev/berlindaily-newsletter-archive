<h2 id="📣-public-sector-strike-called-for-feb-11">📣 Public Sector Strike Called for Feb 11</h2>
<p class="excerpt">Major unions including Verdi and the GEW have called for a comprehensive warning strike across Berlin and Brandenburg on February 11. This coordinated walkout will affect state-run daycares, schools, police, and administration offices to coincide with the start of the third negotiation round in Potsdam. (<a href="https://www.rbb24.de/wirtschaft/beitrag/2026/02/warnstreik-oeffentlicher-dienst-gewerkschaften-tarifverhandlungen-potsdam.html">rbb24</a>)</p>
<p>Negotiations stalled after employers failed to present a concrete offer in previous meetings, sparking outrage with comments about offering inflation adjustments plus &quot;a schnapps on top.&quot; The unions are demanding a 12-month contract with a 7% salary increase, ensuring a minimum rise of €300 per month. (<a href="https://www.gdp.de/berlin/de/stories/2026/02/2026_02_03_warnstreikaufruf-11-feb">Gewerkschaft der Polizei (GdP)</a>)</p>
<p>Unions aim to force a respectable offer, arguing that current proposals ignore severe staffing shortages and real wage losses. While emergency service agreements will ensure safety during police and fire department walkouts, leaders emphasize that failing to invest in public workers threatens the system&#39;s long-term stability. (<a href="https://www.tagesspiegel.de/berlin/neuer-streik-in-berlin-und-brandenburg-offentlicher-dienst-protestiert-am-11-februar-15212045.html">Tagesspiegel</a>)</p>

<h2 id="📉-risk-of-poverty-affects-176-million-germans">📉 Risk of Poverty Affects 17.6 Million Germans</h2>
<p class="excerpt">Germany&#39;s Federal Statistical Office reported Tuesday that roughly 17.6 million people faced the risk of poverty or social exclusion last year, impacting 21.2% of the population. This figure remained virtually unchanged from the previous year, though the specific share of those falling below the income poverty line rose slightly to 16.1% overall. (<a href="https://www.dw.com/en/germany-news-13-million-living-at-risk-of-poverty/live-75779558">DW.com</a>)</p>
<p>The European Union defines the poverty risk threshold as having less than 60% of the national median income. For a single person in Germany, this limit stood at a net monthly income of €1,446, while families with two children required €3,036. Data indicates unemployment remains the highest risk factor, affecting 64.9% of that demographic. (<a href="https://www.tagesschau.de/inland/gesellschaft/armut-mehr-menschen-bedroht-100.html">tagesschau.de</a>)</p>
<p>Social groups are warning that these poverty numbers aren&#39;t just data. They represent real people who can&#39;t afford to heat their homes or pay for a doctor. The Paritätische (Germany&#39;s main social welfare group) is calling on the government to &quot;poverty-proof&quot; all future laws. They argue that if people feel financially abandoned, it will tear society apart and put the country&#39;s democracy at risk.

<h2 id="❄️-body-found-on-frozen-lake">❄️ Body Found on Frozen Lake</h2>
<p class="excerpt">The Berlin Fire Department discovered a body on the ice at the Biesdorfer Baggersee last Thursday, January 29. While the state prosecutor has opened an official death investigation to determine the victim&#39;s identity and specific cause of death, authorities confirmed the individual was already deceased when found. (<a href="https://www.rbb24.de/panorama/beitrag/2026/02/berlin-feuerwehr-findet-toten-an-biesdorfer-baggersee.html">rbb24</a>)</p>
<p>Emergency crews responded to three separate ice rescue incidents across the capital last week, including saving an ice sailor who fell into the Wannsee on January 21. Although thick layers have formed on many ponds, officials warn that a safe load-bearing depth of 15 centimeters has not yet been reached. (<a href="https://www.morgenpost.de/berlin/article411092936/eis-und-frost-polizei-warnt-vor-gefaehrlicher-situation-an-berlins-seen.html">Berliner Morgenpost</a>)</p>
<p>Authorities emphasize that Berlin never issues official clearances for entering frozen water bodies because a risk always remains regardless of apparent thickness. Water police are currently patrolling with specialized &quot;ice wagons&quot; and thermal suits, urging citizens to avoid flowing waters like the Spree and never step onto the ice alone. (<a href="https://www.sueddeutsche.de/panorama/frost-drei-eisrettungen-in-berlin-feuerwehr-findet-toten-an-see-dpa.urn-newsml-dpa-com-20090101-260202-930-631637">SZ.de</a>)</p>

<h2 id="🩺-why-wait-months-for-a-doctors-appointment">🩺 Why Wait Months for a Doctor’s Appointment?</h2>
<p>With public health insurance, you can often wait months for specialist appointments. Switching to private health insurance can change that, giving you access to faster appointments and top-tier medical care. If you earn over €77,400 (employed) or €36,000 (self-employed), Feather makes the switch seamless. </p>
<p>Worried that private health insurance will become too expensive as you age? It’s a myth. Historically, private premiums have actually risen slower than public ones (<a href="https://www.pkv.de/wissen/beitraege/warum-die-beitraege-steigen/">3.1% vs. 3.8% annually</a>). You’ll enjoy faster access to doctors, superior dental and vision care, yearly cashbacks, and of course, with Feather, it will be a digital experience entirely in English. </p>

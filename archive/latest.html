<h2 id="🍰-cocaine-smuggled-in-cream-cakes-from-berlin">🍰 Cocaine Smuggled in Cream Cakes from Berlin</h2>
<p class="excerpt">Police officials investigated a drug ring suspected of trafficking over 30 kilograms of cocaine from Berlin to Prague inside cream-filled cakes. Investigators stated the group concealed one-kilogram bricks of narcotics within the pastries and diligently covered the incisions with whipped cream to completely hide the tampering. (<a href="https://www.rbb24.de/panorama/beitrag/2026/02/berlin-prag-reisebusse-drogen-kokain-sahne-torten-schmuggel.html">rbb24</a>)</p>
<p>The gang allegedly recruited young individuals facing financial hardship to transport the modified sweets individually via commercial buses between the two capitals. Officials noted the operation capitalized on market dynamics (higher prices in the Czech Republic) while also distributing other substances like crystal meth and LSD online. (<a href="https://www.berliner-zeitung.de/news/kokain-in-sahnetorten-versteckt-polizei-hebt-berliner-drogenbande-mit-kurioser-masche-aus-li.10018513">Berliner Zeitung</a>)</p>
<p>Authorities detained five suspects out of eight identified individuals (including one Czech national) who now face potential prison sentences of up to 18 years if convicted. During raids linked to the investigation (involving cash and luxury items), police seized assets valued at approximately €20,000 alongside vehicles. (<a href="https://www.stern.de/panorama/ermittlungen-in-tschechien--kokain-sahne-torten-aus-berlin---polizei-hebt-bande-aus-37127144.html">STERN.de</a>)</p>

<h2 id="🔋-tesla-calls-police-on-union-official-over-recording">🔋 Tesla Calls Police on Union Official Over Recording</h2>
<p class="excerpt">Tesla management accused a representative from the IG Metall labor union of secretly recording a private employee council meeting at its Berlin Gigafactory. Manufacturing director André Thierig stated the company called police to confiscate the individual&#39;s laptop and subsequently filed a criminal complaint. Union officials denied the allegations, calling the charges a calculated lie designed to influence upcoming elections. (<a href="https://www.dw.com/en/germany-tesla-charges-trade-union-member-in-ig-metall-fight/a-75913837">DW.com</a>)</p>
<p>This dispute escalates tensions ahead of works council elections scheduled for early March at the Grünheide facility, which currently employs roughly 11,000 workers. While works councils are standard across Germany, this plant remains the country&#39;s only automotive factory without a collective bargaining agreement. The union is pushing for higher wages and a 35-hour workweek, a demand Thierig rejected. (<a href="https://gizmodo.com/truly-beyond-words-teslas-conflict-with-a-german-labor-union-is-getting-out-of-hand-2000719975">Gizmodo</a>)</p>
<p>Beyond labor friction, Tesla faces lower demand and fierce competition from local rivals like Volkswagen and BMW across Europe. While the Model Y remains a bestseller, German registrations plunged nearly 50% (from 37,5K to 19,4K) in 2025. Future growth relies on obtaining final permits for the Berlin plant&#39;s expansion and launching more affordable models to counter the influx of lower-priced Chinese electric vehicles.

<h2 id="🏭-basf-shifts-berlin-service-jobs-to-india">🏭 BASF Shifts Berlin Service Jobs to India</h2>
<p class="excerpt">Chemical giant BASF announced plans to relocate finance, personnel, and logistics service jobs from its Berlin hub to new centers in India and Malaysia. The restructuring targets the Global Business Services division, which employs approximately 2,800 people in the German capital and 8,500 worldwide. Management stated the transition aims to increase cost efficiency and standardisation, with the full shift expected to complete by late 2028. (<a href="https://www.handelsblatt.com/unternehmen/industrie/chemie-basf-plant-globalen-hub-in-indien-jobabbau-in-berlin-erwartet/100199585.html">Handelsblatt</a>)</p>
<p>This move marks the end of a unique 2005 labor agreement designed to keep these specific roles in Germany rather than outsourcing them to Slovakia. Under that deal, Berlin employees accepted longer hours and lower entry-level salaries to secure the site as a central service hub. Berlin Mayor Kai Wegner criticized the reversal, noting the city had proven itself as a stable location for the corporation for decades. (<a href="https://www.rbb24.de/wirtschaft/beitrag/2026/02/basf-berlin-indien-hub-verlagerung-stellenabbau.html">rbb24</a>)</p>
<p>The decision highlights growing tensions in the German industrial sector as companies seek savings amidst high domestic costs. Union leaders slammed the strategy as irresponsible, contrasting the domestic cuts with the corporation&#39;s massive €8.7 billion investment in a new production site in Zhanjiang, China. While the exact number of layoffs remains unspecified, labor representatives warned that hundreds of digital solution roles across the country also face elimination. (<a href="https://www.tagesspiegel.de/berlin/verlagerungsplane-von-basf-von-berlin-nach-indien-mehr-als-4000-arbeitsplatze-in-der-hauptstadtregion-sind-bedroht-15241830.html">Tagesspiegel</a>)</p>

<h2 id="✈️-lufthansa-strikes-ground-hundreds-of-german-flights">✈️ Lufthansa Strikes Ground Hundreds of German Flights</h2>
<p class="excerpt">Lufthansa grounded approximately 800 flights on Thursday as pilots and cabin crew launched a coordinated 24-hour strike. The walkout affected roughly 100,000 passengers across German hubs like Frankfurt and Munich. Unions Vereinigung Cockpit and UFO organized the industrial action to demand higher pension contributions and secure labor agreements. (<a href="https://www.dw.com/en/germany-lufthansa-strike-grounds-hundreds-of-flights/a-75922927">DW.com</a>)</p>
<p>The dispute involves 4,800 pilots and 20,000 cabin crew members seeking improved contract terms. Tensions have risen as Lufthansa pursues a recovery program with over 700 cost-cutting measures. Management aims to improve earnings by €1.5 billion in 2026 to offset recent operating losses. (<a href="https://www.euronews.com/2026/02/12/lufthansa-strike-thousands-of-flights-affected">Euronews.com</a>)</p>
<p>This mass grounding arrives just one day before world leaders gather for the annual Munich Security Conference. Analysts estimate the cancellations could impact 140,000 seats and cost the airline roughly €27 million in lost revenue. The carrier is currently attempting to rebook affected customers onto partner airlines.

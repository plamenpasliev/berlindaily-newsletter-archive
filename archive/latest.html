<h2 id="💵-germany-approves-€540m-attack-drone-order">💵 Germany Approves €540M Attack Drone Order</h2>
<p class="excerpt">Germany’s parliamentary budget committee has approved an initial €540 million order for thousands of attack drones, often called “kamikaze drones,” from domestic startups Helsing and Stark Defence. The defense ministry had originally proposed a long-term €4.3 billion framework, but lawmakers limited the contract to €2 billion to keep closer control over spending. (<a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/germany-slash-long-term-strike-drone-purchasing-plan-document-shows-2026-02-25/">Reuters</a>)</p>
<p>These drones are designed to circle above a target before striking and are expected to equip the Bundeswehr’s 45th Tank Brigade in Lithuania by 2027. The contract also includes an “innovation clause,” which requires continuous software updates. Unit costs are estimated at around €44,000 for Helsing’s drones and €80,000 for Stark Defence’s models. (<a href="https://www.euractiv.com/news/germany-makes-first-step-towards-new-drone-reality-with-e500-million-deal/">Euractiv</a>)</p>
<p>The purchase marks a broader shift toward venture-backed defense technology as Germany moves to strengthen NATO’s eastern flank in response to the Russian threat. Some lawmakers raised concerns about Stark investor Peter Thiel, but Defense Minister Boris Pistorius defended the deal, saying the US billionaire holds a non-voting stake of less than 10% and has no operational access.

<h2 id="🗳️-far-right-afd-polls-second-in-berlin">🗳️ Far-Right AfD Polls Second in Berlin</h2>
<p class="excerpt">A new INSA poll indicates the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) has climbed to second place in Berlin roughly seven months before state elections. The survey places the Christian Democrats (CDU) in the lead with 22%, followed by the AfD at 17% and the Social Democrats (SPD) at 16%. (<a href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/far-afd-climbs-second-berlin-152827340.html">Yahoo</a>)</p>
<p>The current polling numbers suggest the governing coalition of CDU and SPD would lose its majority, holding only 38% of the vote combined. In the 2023 repeat election, the CDU won decisively with 28.2% while the AfD garnered just 9.1%, meaning the right-wing party has nearly doubled its support since then. (<a href="https://www.tagesspiegel.de/berlin/vor-wahl-zum-abgeordnetenhaus-afd-in-umfrage-erstmals-als-zweitstarkste-kraft-in-berlin-15292789.html">Tagesspiegel</a>)</p>
<p>The Free Democrats (FDP) and the Sahra Wagenknecht Alliance (BSW) are polling at 4%. This is below the threshold to enter parliament so seats would likely be redistributed. This shift makes a three-way left-wing alliance of the SPD, Greens, and The Left mathematically possible, potentially allowing them to form a government without the conservatives.

<h2 id="📞-phone-scams-cost-seniors-€400000">📞 Phone Scams Cost Seniors €400,000</h2>
<p class="excerpt">Berlin police have recorded approximately 20 cases of fraudulent &quot;shock calls&quot; conducted in Russian since the beginning of the year. Authorities report that scammers have stolen roughly €400,000 from victims within just a few weeks through these targeted telephone attacks. The perpetrators specifically focus their efforts on elderly residents who speak the language. (<a href="https://www.morgenpost.de/berlin/article411321123/russischsprachige-schockanrufe-betrueger-erbeuten-hunderttausende-euro-in-berlin.html">Berliner Morgenpost</a>)</p>
<p>Criminals utilize a specific script where a weeping caller pretends to be a relative who caused a fatal traffic accident. A second person posing as a police officer then demands an immediate cash bail payment to prevent imprisonment. This method recently entrapped an 84-year-old man in the Spandau district who handed money to a courier. (<a href="https://www.n-tv.de/regionales/berlin-und-brandenburg/Verstaerkt-Betrueger-Schockanrufe-auf-Russisch-hohe-schaeden-id30409162.html">Ntv</a>)</p>
<p>Law enforcement officials emphasize that genuine officers never request cash or valuables over the phone under any circumstances. Authorities urge residents to remain suspicious of such demands and to contact family members directly using known numbers to verify claims. The frequency of these attempts remains high as investigators warn the public about the varying tactics.

<h2 id="🇩🇪-asking-rents-in-berlin-have-risen-by-almost-100-percent-since-2015">🇩🇪 Asking rents in Berlin have risen by almost 100 percent since 2015</h2>
<p class="excerpt">Berlin’s advertised rents have almost doubled in a decade. According to figures in the official gazette, average asking rents in Berlin rose from €8.45 per m² in 2015 to €16.64 in 2024, a jump of 96.9 %. They now sit 52.4 % above the national average, while Germany overall saw a 49.6 % rise in asking rents. (<a href="https://www.rbb24.de/wirtschaft/beitrag/2025/11/berlin-mieten-angebotsmieten-wohnungsmarkt-mietpreisbremse-amtsblatt.html">rbb24</a>)</p>
<p>The surge reflects a structural housing shortage. Berlin’s population reached about 3.9 million residents at the end of 2024, after years of immigration-driven growth. Yet only 15,362 apartments were completed in 2024, down 3.8 % from 2023, and annual construction targets of 20,000 units have repeatedly been missed, keeping demand far above supply. (<a href="https://www.jll.com/en-de/insights/market-perspectives/germany-living">JLL</a>)</p>
<p>Germany’s main legal tool is the “Mietpreisbremse,” a rent brake that limits prices in new contracts to 10 % above the local reference rent in tight markets. Introduced in 2015, it is regularly evaluated amid debate over whether it effectively slows increases without discouraging new construction. (<a href="https://www.diw.de/en/diw_01.c.603007.en/projects/evaluation_of_the_effectiveness_of_the_rent_control_introduc___en_rent_increases_in_tight_housing_markets__mietpreisbremse.html">DIW Berlin</a>)</p>
<p>Berlin’s latest data underline a growing social and economic strain as new tenants face sharply higher costs than long‑term renters. This divide risks undermining the city’s attractiveness for workers. A recent ifo Institute study found that on average, new leases are €4.48 per square meter more expensive than existing leases, a 48% difference.

<h2 id="⚡-quick-hits">⚡ Quick Hits</h2>
<p>🇩🇪 <a href="https://www.bz-berlin.de/berlin/umfrage-rbb-boeller-verbot-berlin"><em>Berliners want the firecracker ban! 75 percent in favor of a ban</em></a> | Three in four Berliners now want to end private New Year’s Eve fireworks, according to the rbb BerlinTrend survey of 1,185 voters. Support spans most parties and is especially high among women. Many favor central professional shows and extra ban zones. Police unions are increasing pressure, but a full ban is difficult because explosives law is federal.</p>
<p>🇩🇪 <a href="https://www.welt.de/vermischtes/article69202eaab00be2ddef3182db/gewaltserie-in-berlin-vierter-angriff-in-wenigen-wochen-wieder-schuesse-auf-fahrschule.html"><em>Fourth attack in a few weeks - shots fired again at a driving school</em></a> | Unknown attackers again fired at a Berlin driving school, this time in Siemensstadt, with several shots hitting the shop window but causing no injuries. It is the fourth such attack in weeks on branches of a large Turkish-owned school with seven locations. Police are investigating extortion by a protection racket targeting Turkish businesses.</p>
<p>🇬🇧 <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/nov/21/germany-to-classify-date-drugs-as-weapons-in-attempt-to-ensure-justice-for-survivors"><em>Germany to classify date rape drugs as weapons to ensure justice for survivors</em></a> | Germany plans to treat drugging victims in sexual attacks as using a weapon, which will allow tougher charges and sentences. The move follows a rise in reported sexual offences and nearly 266,000 domestic violence cases in 2024. New measures include electronic ankle monitors for offenders and a secure app that helps victims collect evidence for court.</p>
<p>🇩🇪 <a href="https://www.berliner-zeitung.de/mensch-metropole/unter-polizeischutz-dragqueens-lesen-in-berlin-kindern-aus-bilderbuechern-vor-li.10006979"><em>Under police protection: drag queens read picture books to children in Berlin</em></a> | Drag performers Kaey und Vivienne Lovecraft read picture books about friendship and gender roles to children at Berlin’s Humboldt Forum under tight police protection. Outside, about 30 AfD protesters faced roughly 250 counterdemonstrators. Organizers stressed that drag is theatrical costume art, not sexualized content, and reported higher attendance than at previous readings.</p>
<p>🇬🇧 <a href="https://www.dw.com/en/syrian-refugees-in-germany-face-pressure-to-return/a-74833167"><em>Syrian refugees in Germany face pressure to return</em></a> | Germany hosts about 948,000 Syrians, yet only 2,900 have joined a new state-backed return program since January. Many fear losing protection if they visit Syria to assess conditions. Researchers note over one third of Syrians in Germany are under 18 and deeply integrated. Tougher citizenship rules further heighten insecurity and complicate long-term planning.</p>
<p>🇩🇪 <a href="https://www.berliner-zeitung.de/news/time-out-ranking-strasse-in-neukoelln-gehoert-zu-den-coolsten-der-welt-li.10006949"><em>Time Out ranking: This street in Neukölln is one of the coolest in the world</em></a> | Time Out places Berlin’s Maybachufer in Neukölln at number seven on its global list, alongside streets in Rio, New York and Tokyo. The magazine highlights the canal-side weekly market, bars like Ankerklause and vegan chain Brammibal’s Donuts. The ranking reinforces Berlin’s recurring image as a global hotspot for nightlife, food and creative neighborhoods.</p>
<p>🇩🇪 <a href="https://taz.de/Hamas-in-Deutschland/!6131233/"><em>&quot;The next escalation is a matter of time&quot;</em></a> | Hamas expert Kim Robin Stoller warns that planned attacks in Germany and Europe have been in preparation for years and likely exceed what is publicly known. She describes a three-tier Hamas structure in Europe (fundraising, political-social, military) and notes links to organized crime. She expects further jihadist attacks and ongoing radicalization in Germany.</p>
<p>🇩🇪 <a href="https://www.ad-hoc-news.de/boerse/news/ueberblick/phishing-welle-ueberschwemmt-deutschland-im-advent/68381818"><em>Phishing wave floods Germany during Advent</em></a> | Cybercriminals are exploiting Black Week and Christmas stress with record levels of phishing in Germany. AI tools make fake DHL messages, bank emails and online shops look almost flawless, tricking users into sharing card data, installing spying apps or paying bogus fees. Bitkom estimates cybercrime damage in the billions, much of it from identity theft and e‑commerce fraud.</p>

<h2 id="🏠-study-finds-widespread-racism-in-german-housing-market">🏠 Study Finds Widespread Racism in German Housing Market</h2>
<p class="excerpt">A new study reveals significant racial discrimination in Germany’s housing market. Research from the German Center for Integration and Migration Research shows Black and Muslim people are far more likely to be excluded from viewings. In a test, résumés with German-sounding names received viewing invitations 22% of the time, versus 16% for other names. (<a href="https://www.infomigrants.net/en/post/68742/germanys-housing-market-contaminated-by-widespread-racism">InfoMigrants</a>)</p>
<p>Germany’s General Equal Treatment Act (AGG) officially prohibits housing discrimination based on racial or ethnic origin. However, the law&#39;s protections are weaker in practice. A significant loophole exempts landlords who rent out fewer than 50 apartments from many of the law&#39;s provisions, limiting legal recourse for many tenants facing discrimination. (<a href="https://www.cms-lawnow.com/ealerts/2022/11/five-myths-about-anti-discrimination-law-in-germany">CMS LawNow</a>)</p>
<p>Such systemic exclusion from stable housing inflicts lasting harm on the social and economic well-being of affected communities. This is evident across Europe, where housing discrimination remains a significant barrier. According to a wide-ranging EU survey, nearly one in two people of African descent (45%) lives in overcrowded housing, a rate 2.5 times higher than in the general population.

<h2 id="⚖️-berlin-upholds-deportations-despite-new-court-ruling">⚖️ Berlin Upholds Deportations Despite New Court Ruling</h2>
<p class="excerpt">Berlin officials will continue deportations despite a Federal Constitutional Court ruling making them more difficult. Interior State Secretary Christian Hochgrebe stated the city remains capable of acting. The court now requires a judicial warrant to enter an asylum seeker&#39;s room for deportation if they do not open the door, reversing a 2019 law. (<a href="https://www.morgenpost.de/berlin/article410710463/abschieben-wird-schwieriger-was-berlins-politik-von-der-justiz-erwartet.html">Berliner Morgenpost</a>)</p>
<p>The court’s decision is rooted in Germany&#39;s constitution, or Basic Law. Article 13 of this document guarantees the inviolability of the home, protecting a person&#39;s private spatial sphere from state intrusion. This fundamental right means that searches generally require prior authorization from a judge to ensure the protection of privacy. (<a href="https://www.btg-bestellservice.de/pdf/80201000.pdf">German Bundestag</a>)</p>
<p>This ruling adds a legal hurdle to a system already struggling with a high volume of cases. The new warrant requirement could slow down procedures and increase the failure rate of deportations. At the end of 2024, there were still 220,000 migrants in Germany who were officially obliged to leave the country.

<h2 id="📈-berlin-subletting-profits-face-high-court-scrutiny">📈 Berlin Subletting Profits Face High Court Scrutiny</h2>
<p class="excerpt">Germany&#39;s Federal Court of Justice is reviewing a case of alleged profit-driven subletting in Berlin, with a ruling expected in January 2026. The case involves a tenant charging a subtenant more than double the actual rent. This decision could have major consequences for Berlin&#39;s rental market, where subletting is common. (<a href="https://www.berliner-zeitung.de/mensch-metropole/kein-kavaliersdelikt-illegale-untervermietungen-in-berlin-auf-dem-vormarsch-droht-mietern-jetzt-die-kuendigung-li.10010214">Berliner Zeitung</a>)</p>
<p>The case unfolds amid a severe housing crisis in the city. By mid-2025, Berlin’s housing vacancy rate had fallen below 1%, creating intense competition for available units. Asking rents for available apartments surged by 12 % to 15 % year-on-year across most districts, far outpacing new construction and putting immense pressure on tenants. (<a href="https://investropa.com/blogs/news/berlin-rental-market-trends">Investropa</a>)</p>
<p>This shortage has driven up prices in the sublet market, which many students and young professionals rely on. In 2025, the average cost for a room in a Berlin shared flat reached €650 per month. This makes the capital the third-most expensive city in Germany for shared accommodations.

<h2 id="🧊-freezing-rain-halts-departures-at-berlin-airport">🧊 Freezing Rain Halts Departures at Berlin Airport</h2>
<p class="excerpt">Departures at Berlin Brandenburg Airport came to a complete standstill on Thursday morning after rapidly freezing rain rendered aircraft de-icing operations impossible. While incoming flights continued to land safely, ground crews could not treat outgoing planes until conditions improved late in the morning. Officials have warned passengers to anticipate massive delays and ongoing flight cancellations. (<a href="https://www.the-berliner.com/english-news-berlin/no-take-offs-from-ber/">The Berliner</a>)</p>
<p>The thick ice layer required a labor-intensive two-step treatment, extending the necessary de-icing time per jet to 60 minutes—double the usual duration. By midday, airlines had canceled 35 of the 180 scheduled take-offs, while Berlin&#39;s public transport authority suspended the U2 and U3 subway lines on above-ground sections due to dangerous ice formation. (<a href="https://www.zeit.de/gesellschaft/zeitgeschehen/2026-02/flughafen-berlin-ber-fluege-eis-enteisung">DIE ZEIT</a>)</p>
<p>This weather follows Berlin&#39;s coldest January in 16 years, with temperatures averaging nearly three degrees below modern norms. Meteorologists recorded 29 frost days last month compared to the typical 18, leaving the ground deeply frozen. Consequently, falling rain turns into dangerous black ice instantly upon contact with the cold surface. (<a href="https://www.tagesspiegel.de/berlin/der-winter-aus-sicht-eines-meteorologen-berlin-erlebt-kaltesten-januar-seit-16-jahren--und-es-gibt-wieder-eisregen-15218202.html">Tagesspiegel</a>)</p>

<h2 id="📦-germany-orders-amazon-to-repay-€59-million">📦 Germany Orders Amazon to Repay €59 Million</h2>
<p class="excerpt">Germany&#39;s competition authority fined Amazon €59 million after determining the company&#39;s pricing rules for third-party vendors violated antitrust laws. Officials stated that Amazon used algorithms to influence seller pricing and enforce caps, which constitutes an abuse of its dominant market position. The company must now repay profits gained from these specific practices. (<a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/german-regulator-fines-amazon-e59m-for-abuse-of-market-power/">politico.eu</a>)</p>
<p>Regulators found that Amazon penalizes listings with higher prices by removing them from prominent display areas like the &quot;Buy Box&quot; section. This reduced visibility can cause significant sales losses for third-party merchants who account for 60% of items sold on the platform. The agency argued these tactics force sellers to lower rates against their will. (<a href="https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/amazon-germany-fined-70-million-for-influencing-third-party-marketplace-pricing-140000588.html">Engadget</a>)</p>
<p>This marks the first time German enforcers have utilized new regulations from 2023 to seek financial damages directly for pricing conduct. While Amazon argues the order compels them to display uncompetitive offers to shoppers, authorities aim to preserve merchant autonomy. The outcome could reshape how digital marketplaces balance competitive pricing with antitrust compliance across Europe.

<h2 id="🤝-merz-tours-gulf-for-energy-and-defense-deals">🤝 Merz Tours Gulf for Energy and Defense Deals</h2>
<p class="excerpt">German Chancellor Friedrich Merz kicked off a three-day tour of Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and the United Arab Emirates Wednesday to forge stronger energy and defense alliances. Meeting with leaders including Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, Merz pledged a &quot;less restrictive&quot; approach to arms exports while seeking increased liquefied natural gas imports to diversify supply chains. (<a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/germanys-merz-heads-saudi-gulf-quest-new-partners-2026-02-04/">Reuters</a>)</p>
<p>Europe’s largest economy is pivoting away from reliance on American energy amid trade uncertainty under US President Donald Trump. Berlin currently imports about 30% of its LNG from the US, but Merz aims to expand Qatari shipments beyond the current 2 million tons annually. Qatar is already a major stakeholder in German giants like Volkswagen. (<a href="https://www.dw.com/en/germany-news-merz-starts-gulf-trip-with-saudi-arabia-visit/live-75793869">DW.com</a>)</p>
<p>This marks a return to &quot;hard power&quot; politics as Berlin seeks to offset shrinking Russian energy supplies and unpredictable US ties. Merz openly stated that while Gulf nations may not share German values, they are essential for preserving global order, signaling a willingness to overlook human rights concerns to secure defense deals and energy access.

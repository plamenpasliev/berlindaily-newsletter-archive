<h2 id="🇩🇪-what-the-cdu-and-spd-want-to-spend-the-federal-governments-special-fund-on">🇩🇪 What the CDU and SPD want to spend the federal government&#39;s special fund on</h2>
<p class="excerpt">Berlin’s CDU and SPD agreed on a plan to use federal special-fund money. The city expects 5.2 billion euros over twelve years, flowing from January 1, 2025 to December 31, 2036. Earmarks include 700 million for the climate adaptation law, 300 million for water infrastructure, 680 million for trains, 170 million for bridges, and other civic upgrades. (<a href="https://www.rbb24.de/politik/beitrag/2025/11/berlin-cdu-spd-sondervermoegen-ausgaben-planung.html">rbb24</a>)</p>
<p>Berlin’s plan sits within a national investment push. Germany created a 500 billion euro special fund for infrastructure and climate neutrality after amending the constitution in March 2025. The law sets aside 100 billion euros for Länder and municipalities, with expenditures approved over twelve years and financed by federal borrowing. (<a href="https://www.bundesfinanzministerium.de/Content/DE/FAQ/sondervermoegen-infrastruktur-klimaneutralitaet.html">Bundesfinanzministerium</a>)</p>
<p>Berlin’s list targets heat resilience and long-delayed maintenance, but effectiveness will hinge on delivery and how much reaches local projects.</p>

<h2 id="🇬🇧-google-announces-€55-billion-investment-in-germany-including-ai-infrastructure-through-2029">🇬🇧 Google Announces €5.5 Billion Investment in Germany, including AI Infrastructure, through 2029</h2>
<p class="excerpt">Google announced a €5.5 billion investment in Germany for 2026 to 2029. The plan adds a new data center in Dietzenbach, expands the Hanau campus, and grows offices in Berlin, Frankfurt and Munich. Google will recover heat to warm over 2,000 households and extend its Engie clean-power deal. It projects €1.016 billion GDP and about 9,000 jobs yearly. (<a href="https://www.googlecloudpresscorner.com/2025-11-11-Google-Announces-EUR5-5-Billion-Investment-in-Germany,-including-AI-Infrastructure,-through-2029">Google Cloud Press Corner</a>)</p>
<p>Power needs are surging with AI. McKinsey estimates European data center electricity use could grow from 62 terawatt hours to more than 150 terawatt hours by 2030, lifting demand from about 10 gigawatts to 35 gigawatts and roughly 5 percent of Europe’s consumption. That raises grid and siting pressures for hyperscalers. (<a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/europes-data-centre-power-demand-expected-triple-by-2030-mckinsey-report-says-2024-10-23/">Reuters</a>)</p>
<p>Google’s 24/7 carbon-free energy approach aims to match every hour of electricity use with carbon-free supply. The United Nations’ 24/7 Carbon-Free Energy Compact frames this as a procurement and policy model to drive grid decarbonization, moving beyond annual certificate matching toward real-time alignment across technologies, markets and locations.

<h2 id="🇬🇧-personalization-in-travel-how-berlin-airport-turns-data-and-ai-into-real-passenger-value">🇬🇧 Personalization in Travel: How Berlin Airport Turns Data and AI Into Real Passenger Value</h2>
<p class="excerpt">Berlin Brandenburg Airport (BER) is transforming the passenger experience by focusing on personalization and &quot;digital handholding.&quot; Led by Christian Draeger, the strategy centers the entire passenger journey, not just the airport itself. This is achieved through physical personalization, with two terminals designed for different travelers: one for comfort (T1) and one for speed (T2). BER also improved security with CT scanners to reduce friction.</p>
<p>A key innovation is &quot;Berry,&quot; an AI virtual assistant that replaced the call center, cutting costs and improving satisfaction. BER uses AI for operations, like aircraft turnarounds, and plans to expand Berry to contextual chat. The ultimate goal is a seamless, stress-free journey.(<a href="https://www.cxtoday.com/service-management-connectivity/personalization-in-travel-how-berlin-airport-turns-data-and-ai-into-real-passenger-value/">CX Today</a>)</p>
<p>Traffic is climbing. BER handled 2.66 million passengers in October 2025, around 100,000 more than a year earlier. The autumn holidays produced the airport’s busiest day since opening, with 102,059 travelers on 17 October. Such peaks heighten pressure on queues, staffing, and information flows that personalization and automation aim to ease.

<h2 id="🔌-sabotage-cuts-power-to-thousands-in-berlin">🔌 Sabotage Cuts Power to Thousands in Berlin</h2>
<p class="excerpt">A far-left activist organization known as the &quot;Volcano Group&quot; claimed responsibility for an arson attack on a high-voltage cable bridge in Berlin on Saturday. The sabotage cut electricity to approximately 50,000 households and 2,000 businesses, primarily in the city&#39;s southwest districts. The perpetrators stated their goal was to target the fossil fuel industry, specifically the Lichterfelde gas-fired power plant. (<a href="https://www.nysun.com/article/thousands-in-berlin-face-no-electricity-for-days-after-far-left-climate-activists-attack-power-grid">The New York Sun</a>)</p>
<p>The blackout left tens of thousands of residents without heating during freezing temperatures and snowfall. While grid operator Stromnetz Berlin restored power to about 10,000 customers by Sunday morning, full restoration for the remaining 30,000 households is not expected until Thursday afternoon. Local officials opened emergency shelters in gymnasiums and deployed warming buses to assist vulnerable elderly and disabled residents. (<a href="https://www.berliner-kurier.de/berlin/erste-nacht-ohne-strom-zehntausende-frieren-in-der-dunkelheit-li.10012497">Berliner Kurier</a>)</p>
<p>Security authorities authenticated a letter from the group titled &quot;Cutting off the Power to the Rulers.&quot; The text justified the arson as &quot;self-defense&quot; against climate change and expressed limited sympathy for villa owners in the wealthy affected districts. This attack follows a similar pattern to a March 2024 arson by a related &quot;Volcano&quot; cell that targeted a Tesla Gigafactory, halting production for days and causing significant financial losses.

<h2 id="🧊-germany-faces--20°c-frosts">🧊 Germany Faces -20°C Frosts</h2>
<p class="excerpt">Germany is facing a severe cold snap affecting all 400 districts, with extreme conditions expected to last through the weekend of January 10. Temperatures will drop significantly nationwide, reaching lows between -15°C and -20°C in snowy regions where ground heat cannot escape. Even during the day, many areas will remain in a deep freeze with highs barely rising above -5°C. (<a href="https://www.merkur.de/deutschland/wetter-warnung-fuer-400-landkreise-tagelange-eiszeit-in-deutschland-mit-teils-minus-20-grad-zr-94107895.html">Merkur</a>)</p>
<p>The weather has already caused chaos on the roads, particularly in Berlin and Brandenburg where police reported around 115 weather-related accidents by Sunday. Key incidents included a gas truck crash that blocked the A9 motorway and a multi-vehicle collision on the A10 that left two people seriously injured. The A100 city highway in Berlin was also forced to close for several hours due to dangerous ice buildup. (<a href="https://www.rbb24.de/panorama/beitrag/2026/01/berlin-brandenburg-wintereinbruch-unfaelle-glatteis-a100-a9-nauen.html">rbb24</a>)</p>
<p>Meteorological conditions are driven by a low-pressure system over the Baltic Sea pushing polar air into the capital region. Forecasters expect continued snow and graupel showers with fresh accumulations of one to three centimeters. Nighttime temperatures in Berlin will slide to -5°C early in the week before plunging to -10°C or even -12°C by Wednesday.

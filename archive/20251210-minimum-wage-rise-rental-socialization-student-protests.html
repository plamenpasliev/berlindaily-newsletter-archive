<h2 id="📈-berlins-minimum-wage-rises-to-€1484-per-hour">📈 Berlin&#39;s minimum wage rises to €14.84 per hour</h2>
<p class="excerpt">Berlin’s Senate has approved a statutory instrument raising the state minimum wage from €13.69 to €14.84 per hour on January 1, 2026, and to €15.59 in 2027. The rule covers sectors where Berlin has financial influence, including the civil service, state-owned firms, and publicly funded social welfare organizations. (<a href="https://www.berlin.de/en/news/10070215-5559700-berliner-landesmindestlohn-steigt-auf-14.en.html">Berlin.de</a>)</p>
<p>Berlin officials estimate that at least 350,000 employees subject to social insurance contributions will benefit, equal to about 20% of all workers in the city. In parallel, Germany’s federal minimum wage is scheduled to rise from €12.82 in 2025 to €13.90 in 2026 and €14.60 in 2027 under a federal ordinance. (<a href="https://germancorrespondent.com/2025/10/29/federal-cabinet-endorses-minimum-wage-increase-to-13-90-euros-by-2026/">GermanCorrespondent</a>)</p>
<p>Nationally, roughly 6 million workers currently earn the federal minimum wage of €12.82, and a full-time worker at that rate receives about €2,161–€2,222 gross per month. The planned federal increases to €13.90 and €14.60 by 2027 represent a cumulative rise of roughly 14%, the steepest since Germany introduced a minimum wage in 2015 at €8.50. (<a href="https://www.pkf.de/en/pkf-magazine/issues/2025/issue-9-25/minimum-wage-amounts">PKF Deutschland</a>)</p>
<p>Policymakers argue that low-wage work must still fund a basic life, and Germany’s Labor Ministry says the minimum wage aims to secure adequate living standards while stabilizing social security systems.

<p>🇩🇪 <a href="https://www.morgenpost.de/berlin/article410656923/deutsche-wohnen-co-enteignen-parlament-diskutiert-gesetzentwurf.html"><em>Socialization of large housing corporations</em></a> | Berlin lawmakers are examining a citizen-drafted law to transfer about 220,000 private rental units into public ownership. The initiative argues the buyout could cost 10-17 billion euros and be covered by future rents. Critics warn compensation could reach 42 billion euros and say expropriation would scare investors and raise Berlin’s broader borrowing costs.</p>
<p>🇬🇧 <a href="https://www.wsws.org/en/articles/2025/12/09/pdqu-d09.html"><em>Tens of thousands of students strike throughout Germany against militarisation and conscription</em></a> | Protests coincided with passage of the Military Service Modernisation Act, which will require all 18-year-old men to register and undergo exams from 2026, with potential call-ups if volunteers fall short. Many students linked conscription to broader rearmament, social spending cuts, and fears of a wider war, criticizing both governing and nominally left-wing parties.</p>
<p>🇩🇪 <a href="https://www.berliner-zeitung.de/mensch-metropole/guenstiger-als-fliegen-mit-govolta-neuer-low-cost-zug-berlinamsterdam-startet-im-maerz-2026-li.10009370"><em>Cheaper than flying: New low-cost Berlin–Amsterdam train starts in March 2026</em></a> | Private operator GoVolta plans a low-cost Berlin–Amsterdam train from March 2026, with tickets from 10 euros but many add-on fees (for seat selection and larger luggage). The service will be slower than Deutsche Bahn but offer more seats and a lounge car. GoVolta aims to rival airlines on price while expanding routes across Western Europe.</p>
<p>🇩🇪 <a href="https://www.berliner-kurier.de/berlin/in-diesem-berliner-bezirk-wartet-man-monate-auf-die-geburtsurkunde-li.10009179"><em>You wait months for a birth certificate</em></a> | New parents in Berlin face long waits for birth certificates, which they need for key benefits like parental allowance and health insurance. In Friedrichshain-Kreuzberg, processing can take around 12 weeks instead of the advertised two. Families risk weeks without income if both parents pause work. Officials cite overloaded registry offices and staff shortages.</p>
<p>🇩🇪 <a href="https://www.morgenpost.de/berlin/article410665483/gymnasium-in-berlin-diese-bildungspolitik-ist-eine-bankrotterklaerung.html"><em>This education policy is a declaration of bankruptcy</em></a> | Berlin’s new rule ties a child’s path to a Gymnasium (college-prep high school) to a 2.2 grade average in core subjects. Supporters say it eases pressure and prevents later failure, since many weaker students switched schools after a year. Critics argue grades reflect family background, so the cutoff deepens inequality and ignores broader talents.</p>
<p>🇩🇪 <a href="https://www.berliner-kurier.de/berlin/neue-parkzonen-in-berlin-bringen-chaos-polizei-warnt-vor-regelungsflut-li.10009421"><em>New parking zones in Berlin bring chaos – police warn of a flood of regulations!</em></a> | Berlin has added new paid parking zones in several districts, ending many free spaces and increasing expected parking fines. The police union says the central fine office was not consulted and is already overloaded. Staff shortages, old IT systems, and rising backlogs could delay processing. The union urges more personnel and rapid digital upgrades.</p>

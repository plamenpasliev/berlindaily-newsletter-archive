<h2 id="🇩🇪-how-the-police-are-tackling-gun-violence-in-berlin">🇩🇪 How the police are tackling gun violence in Berlin</h2>
<p class="excerpt">Berlin police are targeting a surge in gun violence, with over 400 shooting incidents recorded by late October, already surpassing the total for 2024. Authorities believe the spike is caused by turf wars among criminal groups, often over drug territories and dominance, fueled by significant profits. (<a href="https://www.rbb24.de/panorama/beitrag/2025/12/berlin-schusswaffen-vorfaelle-polizei-drogenmilieu.html">rbb24</a>)</p>
<p>Germany’s federal data show firearm-enabled crimes have been rising since 2021. In 2024, police recorded 9,460 offences involving guns. Officers reported 4,685 threats with firearms and 4,775 actual shots fired. Berlin registered the most incidents of shots fired among states. The broader category of weapons law offences totalled 36,056 cases in 2024. (<a href="https://www.bka.de/SharedDocs/Kurzmeldungen/DE/Kurzmeldungen/250714_BLBWaffenkriminalitaet.html">BKA</a>)</p>
<p>A special unit of up to 100 officers is conducting targeted operations day and night. They are focusing on known individuals and hotspots like cafes and betting shops. The primary goal is to disarm these groups immediately, seize illegal firearms, and prevent further public shootouts. (<a href="https://www.n-tv.de/regionales/berlin-und-brandenburg/Schuesse-auf-Berlins-Strassen-Polizei-weitet-Ermittlungen-aus-article26133697.html">n-tv</a>)</p>

<h2 id="🇩🇪-berlin-car-free-bill-rejected---initiative-wants-to-bring-about-referendum">🇩🇪 &quot;Berlin car-free&quot; bill rejected - initiative wants to bring about referendum</h2>
<p class="excerpt">Berlin’s parliament rejected the “Volksentscheid Berlin autofrei” bill, clearing the way for a signature drive in early 2026. Organizers will start in January and must collect support from seven percent of voters within four months. A vote could coincide with the 20 September state election. The plan would curb car use inside the S-Bahn ring after four years. (<a href="https://www.tagesspiegel.de/berlin/berlin-autofrei-parlament-lehnt-gesetzentwurf-ab--initiative-will-volksentscheid-herbeifuhren-14773187.html">Tagesspiegel</a>)</p>
<p>Mobility data suggest the inner city is less car-dependent than many assume. The 2023 “Mobility in Cities” survey logged about 40,000 Berlin participants. It found motorized individual transport at 22 percent of trips citywide and about 10 percent in the inner city, with walking at 38.5 percent and cycling at 22 percent. (<a href="https://www.berlin.de/sen/uvk/mobilitaet-und-verkehr/verkehrsdaten/zahlen-und-fakten/mobilitaet-in-staedten-srv-2023/">Berlin.de</a>)</p>
<p>The campaign will test how far Berliners are willing to trade private car access for climate and safety goals. It also pressures policymakers to offer credible alternatives for commuters and deliveries. Germany’s expert council found the transport sector exceeded its 2023 emissions limit by 12.8 million tonnes of CO2 equivalent.

<h2 id="🇩🇪-coke-by-qr-code-new-drug-scam-floods-berlin">🇩🇪 Coke by QR-code: New drug scam floods Berlin</h2>
<p class="excerpt">A new drug-dealing trend is spreading across Berlin using QR code stickers disguised as street art. Scanning the codes leads users to anonymous messenger chats with menus for cocaine and other drugs, often promising delivery within ten minutes. This &quot;drug taxi&quot; system, which functions like a routine delivery service, was previously seen in Hamburg, where police are already investigating a network. (<a href="https://www.berliner-zeitung.de/mensch-metropole/sticker-code-chat-drogen-per-qr-code-in-berlin-mitte-li.10004239">Berliner Zeitung</a>)</p>
<p>The method also poses cybersecurity risks through quishing, which is phishing executed with QR codes. Scans can redirect to counterfeit banking or payment pages or trigger malware downloads. Germany’s financial regulator advises scanning only when the destination is known and enabling link previews. It urges caution with codes in emails or messages. (<a href="https://www.bafin.de/SharedDocs/Veroeffentlichungen/DE/Verbrauchermitteilung/weitere/2024/meldung_2024_10_07_Quishing.html">BaFin</a>)</p>
<p>This hybrid street‑to‑chat model lowers barriers for buyers and strains enforcement and youth protection. It also blurs cybercrime and drug dealing. The scale of supply underscores the challenge. In 2023, European Union states seized a record 419 tonnes of cocaine, including 43 tonnes in Germany, with trafficking shifting to smaller loads.

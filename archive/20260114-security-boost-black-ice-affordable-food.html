<h2 id="🛡️-berlin-boosts-grid-security">🛡️ Berlin Boosts Grid Security</h2>
<p class="excerpt">Berlin Mayor Kai Wegner announced that private security firms will immediately replace police in guarding the city’s power grid following the major arson attack on January 3rd. The Vulkangruppe (Volcano Group), a left-wing radical organization, has claimed responsibility, citing opposition to &quot;AI data centers&quot; and fossil fuel dependency. (<a href="https://www.rbb24.de/wirtschaft/beitrag/2026/01/privater-wachschutz-sensible-einrichtungen-stromversorgung-berli.html">rbb24</a>)</p>
<p>Interior Senator Iris Spranger warned that the city spends &quot;far too little&quot; on disaster protection, currently allocating just over €3 per capita when €5 is needed. She called for federal support to purchase emergency generators, expand the siren network, and upgrade software to better protect the &quot;heart of the Federal Republic.&quot; A task force will now develop measures to secure public infrastructure. (<a href="https://www.tagesschau.de/inland/innenpolitik/kritische-infrastruktur-investition-debatte-100.html">tagesschau.de</a>)</p>
<p>This incident highlights the fragility of modern urban networks where a single physical attack can turn into a communications and heating crisis. The Senate aims to centralize crisis management at the state level, acknowledging that district-level responses were overwhelmed during the blackout. Wegner emphasized that police cannot permanently guard commercial assets, marking a shift toward operator responsibility for physical security. (<a href="https://www.tagesspiegel.de/berlin/werden-diesen-weg-schnell-gehen-wegner-drangt-auf-konsequenzen-aus-stromausfall--to-do-liste-soll-in-zwei-wochen-stehen-15133057.html">Tagesspiegel</a>)</p>

<h2 id="🧊-black-ice-and-freezing-rain">🧊 Black Ice and Freezing Rain</h2>
<p class="excerpt">Berlin emergency services reached their limit on Tuesday as freezing rain turned streets into skating rinks. The fire department declared a &quot;Level 3&quot; emergency, deploying 30 extra ambulances to handle over 100 fall-related calls by noon. Hospitals like UKB reported a surge in fractures and head injuries, describing the workload as &quot;maximally burdened.&quot; (<a href="https://www.morgenpost.de/berlin/article410923041/extreme-glaette-am-dienstag-feuerwehr-bilanziert-hohes-einsatzaufkommen.html">Berliner Morgenpost</a>)</p>
<p>The weather impact was severe in surrounding Brandenburg, where officials suspended mandatory school attendance to protect students. In Potsdam-Mittelmark, the accumulated snow load caused a cattle shed roof to collapse, trapping 20 cows and forcing rescue crews to partially demolish the structure to free the animals from the wreckage. (<a href="https://www.rbb24.de/panorama/beitrag/2026/01/berlin-brandenburg-wetter-glatteis-gefahr-glaette-gefrierender-regen-schnee.html">rbb24.de</a>)</p>
<p>Commuters also face a difficult week as the severe weather coincides with major scheduled construction on the U1, U3, and U4 subway lines. The U4 line is completely suspended, while the S-Bahn and regional trains expect significant delays due to frozen switches. Additionally, Deutsche Bahn has reduced maximum speeds on ICE routes to mitigate risks on the slippery tracks, adding to the logistical chaos dubbed a &quot;horror week&quot; for transit users. (<a href="https://www.berliner-kurier.de/verkehr/berlin-erwartet-eine-horrorwoche-fuer-alle-s-u-bahn-und-regio-fahrgaeste-li.10013553">Berliner Kurier</a>)</p>
<h2 id="🛒-spd-proposes-affordable-staple-foods">🛒 SPD Proposes Affordable Staple Foods</h2>
<p class="excerpt">The Social Democratic Party (SPD) unveiled a plan to combat rising inflation by introducing a &quot;Germany Basket&quot; of affordable staple foods. This voluntary initiative encourages supermarket chains to offer a specific range of price-stable, domestically produced essential goods across major product categories to relieve consumer budgets. (<a href="https://www.fr.de/politik/spd-mit-kampfansage-an-einzelhandel-genossen-wollen-guenstigen-deutschland-korb-94118680.html">Frankfurter Rundschau</a>)</p>
<p>Modeled after a similar program in Greece that reduced prices on over 2,000 items, the proposal addresses severe cost-of-living pressures. Federal data indicates domestic food prices have surged by more than 35% since 2020, forcing many low-income households to restrict purchases of fresh produce and meat. (<a href="https://www.tagesschau.de/inland/innenpolitik/spd-plan-gegen-hohe-lebensmittelpreise-100.html">tagesschau.de</a>)</p>
<p>Industry representatives and the German Farmers&#39; Association (DBV) immediately rejected the concept, with DBV President Joachim Rukwied dismissing it as a &quot;socialist designated basket.&quot; Critics argue that current market prices reflect increased production costs—including energy, minimum wages, and bureaucracy—rather than arbitrary retail markups. The program&#39;s ultimate success relies on the voluntary cooperation of major grocery retailers to participate.(<a href="https://rp-online.de/politik/deutschland/plan-der-spd-deutschland-korb-soll-gegen-teure-lebensmittel-helfen_aid-142077097">RP Online</a>)</p>

<h2 id="🇩🇪-greens-focus-on-affordable-rents-and-better-public-transport">🇩🇪 Greens focus on affordable rents and better public transport</h2>
<p class="excerpt">Berlin’s Green party has presented a 125‑page draft platform for the September 2026 Abgeordnetenhaus election under the slogan “Change politics, keep Berlin.” The program prioritizes housing, including stricter limits on holiday rentals, more support for housing cooperatives, and a “Affordable Rents Law” requiring large landlords to offer a share of flats at lower prices. (<a href="https://www.tagesspiegel.de/berlin/programm-fur-berlin-wahl-2026-vorgestellt-grune-setzen-auf-bezahlbare-mieten-und-besseren-opnv-15011287.html">Tagesspiegel</a>)</p>
<p>The housing push comes amid sharply rising asking rents in Berlin. The city’s median advertised rent reached 15.74 €/m² in 2024, a 12.5 % jump in one year and an 85 % rise since 2015, according to the Investitionsbank Berlin’s latest market report. New supply lags behind demand, with only 15,965 dwellings completed in 2023 for a population of 3.78 million. (<a href="https://www.ibb.de/de/ueber-uns/publikationen/wohnungsmarktbericht/2024.html">Investitionsbank Berlin</a>)</p>
<p>High rents are straining many household budgets. An analysis of microcensus data found that 43.8 % of Berlin households spend more than 30 % of their income on rent, a level social researchers view as financially risky. Around 220,000 households pay over 40 %, leaving little room for other living costs and increasing the risk of poverty. (<a href="https://www.tagesschau.de/wirtschaft/verbraucher/mietpreis-boeckler-studie-grossstaedte-einkommen-miete-101.html">Tagesschau</a>)</p>
<p>The program signals that housing affordability and transport reliability will likely dominate Berlin’s 2026 campaign. These issues directly affect daily life for millions of residents. Nearly one in two Berlin renter households already crosses the 30 % rent‑to‑income threshold, underlining how central any effective “Affordable Rents Law” or transit upgrade will be for voters.

<h2 id="⚡-quick-hits">⚡ Quick Hits</h2>
<p>🇩🇪 <a href="https://www.tip-berlin.de/familie/kitasterben-berlin-weniger-standorte-falko-liecke-interview/"><em>97 fewer Kitas since 2023</em></a> | Berlin has shut 97 daycare sites from 2023 to 2025 as falling birthrates, higher rents, and child-based funding strain especially small providers. Demand shifts between inner-city and outer districts, leaving some Kitas under 80% capacity and financially vulnerable. A new daycare law from 2026 aims to improve staff ratios, stabilize 2,400 jobs, and enhance parental choice.</p>
<p>🇬🇧 <a href="https://www.berlin.de/en/news/8525332-5559700-emergency-aid-for-homeless-cold-weather-.en.html"><em>Emergency aid for homeless: Cold weather buses and shelters</em></a> | Berlin expects freezing temperatures, putting more than 6,000 homeless people at serious risk. Local groups, including Caritas and Berlin City Mission, outline practical help. Residents can offer hot drinks, call the cold weather bus (with consent), or volunteer in shelters. Donations of washed, intact warm clothing, large men’s shoes, sleeping bags, food, and money are especially needed.</p>
<p>🇬🇧 <a href="https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/news/deutsche-telekom-hooks-up-berlin-data-center-to-local-district-heating-system/"><em>Deutsche Telekom hooks up Berlin data center to local district heating system</em></a> | The project captures low-temperature waste heat from a Deutsche Telekom data center and upgrades it via a heat pump to supply about 65% of heating for 500 apartments in a 1970s complex. It connects through a 140-meter district heating pipe. The scheme illustrates Germany’s 2023 Energy Efficiency Act push to reuse data center heat nationwide.</p>
<p>🇬🇧 <a href="https://www.dw.com/en/germany-news-fraught-pension-package-passes-cdu-test-vote/live-74976294"><em>Fraught pension package passes CDU test vote</em></a> | Young lawmakers in Chancellor Friedrich Merz’s CDU had threatened to sink a pension bill that fixes benefits at 48% of average income until 2031, with costs projected at €11 billion by then and up to €15 billion annually afterward. A strong internal test vote eases fears of a coalition collapse ahead of Friday’s decisive Bundestag vote.</p>
<p>🇩🇪 <a href="https://www.berliner-zeitung.de/mensch-metropole/kulturschock-blickkontakt-wie-der-german-stare-neuankoemmlinge-in-berlin-aus-der-fassung-bringt-li.10008489"><em>How the “German Stare” throws newcomers in Berlin off balance</em></a> | Newcomers to Berlin often encounter the infamous &quot;German Stare&quot;, an intense, prolonged eye contact that feels aggressive but is culturally benign. Unlike the friendly American smile, polite British avoidance, or respectful Japanese aversion, Berliners utilize a direct, neutral gaze. It’s not a threat; it’s simply a unique form of Prussian observational curiosity.</p>
<p>🇩🇪 <a href="https://www.ingenieur.de/technik/fachbereiche/energie/energiewende-in-deutschland-droht-ins-stocken-zu-geraten/"><em>Germany&#39;s energy transition is in danger of stalling.</em></a> | German officials warn that climate targets risk slipping without faster action on renewables, grids, and transport. Germany must cut CO2 by 60% and raise renewables to 80% of power by 2030 (it is heading for 60%). Planned reforms include an updated Renewable Energy Act, new funding rules, and Contracts for Difference to stabilize green investment.</p>

<p>Today’s recommendation comes from reader <strong>Charlie L.</strong>, part of a volunteer group that has cleared over <strong>3,000kg of waste</strong> from different areas across Berlin:</p>
<p>&quot;We are Litter Pickers Berlin, a volunteer and social action group operating for 2.5 years. We clean all over Berlin, and we decide our next location by group vote. The group is a great way to socialize and give something back to the city. It is also extremely multicultural, accessible and easy to join.&quot; </p>

<p>💡 <strong>Fun Fact:</strong> More than <strong>30,000 gas street lamps</strong> still light Berlin’s streets – over half of all the gaslamps remaining in the world. The gentle glow of these 19th-century lamps gives many Berlin neighborhoods a nostalgic charm at night.</p>

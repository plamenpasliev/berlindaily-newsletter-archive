<h2 id="🏠-berlin-opens-new-shelter-for-women-and-children">🏠 Berlin Opens New Shelter for Women and Children</h2>
<p class="excerpt">Berlin opened a new protection center for women and children fleeing domestic violence (Frauenhaus) in the southern part of the city. The 2.5 million euro facility features ten apartments with 26 family spots and already houses 18 women and 13 children. Its location remains confidential to ensure the safety of residents. (<a href="https://www.rbb24.de/panorama/beitrag/2026/02/berlin-frauenhaus-eroeffnet-schutz-vor-gewalt.html">rbb24</a>)</p>
<p>Demand for safe housing is rising as authorities recorded a record 42,751 female victims of violence in the capital during 2024. Under the Istanbul Convention, a human rights treaty, the city must provide 390 cost-free family places. This metric is designed to ensure that protection is a guaranteed right rather than a resource dependent on availability, addressing a chronic shortage that often forces Berlin shelters to turn away victims during peak demand. (<a href="https://www.tagesspiegel.de/berlin/neustart-in-ein-gewaltfreies-leben-berlin-eroffnet-neuntes-frauenhaus-15272270.html">Tagesspiegel</a>)</p>
<p>In many traditional Frauenhäuser, boys are only allowed to stay with their mothers until they reach age 12 or 14. Once they hit that age limit, they are often deemed &quot;adult men&quot; by house rules, meaning a mother with a teenage son would either have to leave her son behind (often in the care of the youth office) or remain in an abusive household to stay with him. This new facility specifically focuses on mothers and allows sons to remain with them until adulthood. (<a href="https://www.sueddeutsche.de/wirtschaft/haeusliche-gewalt-schutz-vor-gewalt-neues-frauenhaus-in-berlin-dpa.urn-newsml-dpa-com-20090101-260220-930-713314">SZ.de</a>)</p>

<h2 id="🚨-twelve-injured-in-head-on-bus-collision-in-berlin">🚨 Twelve Injured in Head-On Bus Collision in Berlin</h2>
<p class="excerpt">Twelve people were injured Sunday afternoon when a car collided head-on with a BVG bus in Spandau. A 46-year-old driver reportedly steered into oncoming traffic on Gatower Straße around 1:30 p.m., striking the X34 bus before the public transit vehicle subsequently crashed into a tree. (<a href="https://www.rbb24.de/panorama/beitrag/2026/02/berlin-spandau-unfall-pkw-bus-bvg-verletzte.html">rbb24</a>)</p>
<p>Emergency services declared a mass casualty incident, deploying more than 50 firefighters and police officers to the scene. The car&#39;s driver suffered life-threatening injuries and was airlifted to a hospital, while the bus driver and ten passengers were treated for minor injuries at nearby clinics. (<a href="https://www.morgenpost.de/berlin/article411282564/schwerer-unfall-mit-bvg-bus-in-berlin-gatow-zwoelf-verletzte.html">Berliner Morgenpost</a>)</p>
<p>Authorities completely closed the accident site for several hours to secure evidence, including aerial drone photography to reconstruct the collision. Police have launched an investigation to determine why the driver lost control of the vehicle, though officials stated the exact cause currently remains unclear.

<h2 id="🐻-yellow-letters-wins-golden-bear-amid-gaza-protests">🐻 &#39;Yellow Letters&#39; Wins Golden Bear Amid Gaza Protests</h2>
<p class="excerpt">Ilker Çatak’s &quot;Yellow Letters&quot; secured the Golden Bear, marking the first German win in 22 years. The drama follows Turkish artists facing state persecution, a theme jury president Wim Wenders called a terrifying premonition. Sandra Hüller earned a Silver Bear for &quot;Rose,&quot; while British icons Anna Calder-Marshall and Tom Courtenay shared acting honors for the dementia drama &quot;Queen at Sea.&quot; (<a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/ilker-catak-yellow-letters-wins-berlin-golden-bear-1236511442/">The Hollywood Reporter</a>)</p>
<p>Speeches focused heavily on the fragile status of the October 2025 ceasefire. Awardees like Marie-Rose Osta used the stage to condemn recent violations, noting that Lebanese and Palestinian children still lack protection from ongoing strikes. Palestinian filmmaker Abdallah Al-Khatib received the Best First Feature prize, using his platform to accuse the German government of complicity in continued regional violence. (<a href="https://www.thenationalnews.com/arts-culture/film-tv/2026/02/22/berlin-film-festival-winners-gaza/">The National News</a>)</p>
<p>Wim Wenders addressed the stormy seas of the festival in a nuanced closing speech. He sought to bridge the gap between empathetic cinema and effective activism following earlier backlash over his perceived neutrality. Director Tricia Tuttle defended the friction as a sign of relevance, noting that the festival’s emotional charge proves the Berlinale is effectively doing its job.
